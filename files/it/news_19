<h4>22. Nov 2002, Version 0.91.1 stable released</h4>
<p>
A minor bug-fixing release, which also happens to contain all the working
new features that have been already added in the 0.92u version.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Will now verify the SHA1 of downloaded files in the background.
<li>New configuration parameter for the directory where "bad files" not
  matching their advertised SHA1 should be put (don't forget to configure
  it, as it defaults to /tmp).
<li>Files are now copied in the background, so it is possible to setup the
  various "download" directories on different filesystems.
<li>Node connection time and remote node's uptime (if available) are now shown.
<li>It is now possible to paste a "magnet:" URI in the search to launch a
  SHA1 search.
<li>The "connection indicator" at the bottom left is now a toggle.  Depressing
  it will terminate any Gnet connection but will continue to serve uploads and
  process downloads.
<li>The active download status now shows how many sources are available and
  how many are currently active (i.e. downloading).  It will also show the
  estimated remaining time for the whole file, as well as the global reception
  rate for the file, accounting for all currently active sources.
<li>Fixed bug that prevented proper downloading from recent BearShare (4.1.x or
  better) and Shareaza (1.6.0.x or better) nodes when the SHA1 of the file
  is known.
<li>Will now protect against "PUSH floods" by banning the relevant IPs.
<li>At startup, scan the download "tmp" dir for orphan files and reintegrate
  them into the fileinfo database, moving completed files to the relevant
  directory (depending on whether its SHA1 checked OK).
<li>Minor bug fixing: improper countdown for push timeout when falling back,
  fixed corner-case processing that could lead to crashes or incorrect
  behaviour, accidental localization on X-Live-Since headers, freezing of the
  GUI when clearing many uploads, obscure portability fixes.
</ul>
<p>
We strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible.

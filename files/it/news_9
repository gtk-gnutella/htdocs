<h4>16. March 2002, gtk-gnutella with Configurable Bandwidth Use</h4>
<p>
Version 0.80 stable has been out quite a while now, and Raphael has continued
development on the CVS version (0.85 unstable) and added or fixed many many
features. It's really worth downloading current gtk-gnutella from CVS and
giving it a try. One of the most important enhancements had been the inclusion
of bandwidth management. GG can now be configured to not use more than 
x&nbsp;bytes/sec, this works really great over modem or slow DSL lines.<br>
To configure bandwidth management you have to change the values for <kbd>output_bandwidth</kbd>
and <kbd>input_bandwidth</kbd> in your ~/.gtk-gnutella/config file.
I have mine set to 10240 and 40960, this still leaves some room on
my 512/128kbit/sec line.

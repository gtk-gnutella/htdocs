<h4>21 March 2010, Version 0.96.8 Released</h4>

<p>Version 0.96.8 is a stable release, containing <em>critical</em>
bug fixes for the previous release 0.96.7</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<ul>
<li>Removed an obsolete assertion now that gtk-gnutella supports NOPE
    DHT values. This was causing a crash each time a NOPE value was received
    in response to push-proxies queries in the DHT.</li>
<li>Fixed memory alignment problem for non-forgiving CPU architectures.</li>
<li>The virtual memory manager would crash when the kernel starts allocating
    pages in zones we wrongly thought were already used.</li>
<li>Fixed long-standing bug in the Query Routing Table protocol where a RESET
    message with the wrong table size could sometimes be sent, causing the
	remote node to close the connection.</li>
<li>Make sure an ultrapeer is not publishing NOPE values in the DHT if support
    for the DHT was disabled by user, which would be triggering a fatal
	assertion failure.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Under the Hood</h5>

<ul>
<li>Fixed Makefile to ensure proper compilation under Gentoo's
    build scripts.</li>
<li>Push-proxy client support now makes sure there is a space after a leading
    GET or HEAD word in the HTTP request.</li>
<li>The DIME parsing layer now given more information in case of an error.</li>
<li>Let THEX downloads peruse any supplied Content-Length information from the
    server (applicable only when the output is not chunked).</li>
<li>The VMM layer is now smarter at identifying foreign pages when allocating
    blocks larger than a single page.</li>
<li>When sending BYE messages, do not shutdown the socket layer if
    using TLS.</li>
<li>Compilation cleanup for SunOS, Sun Studio, and versions of
	GTK &lt; 2.5.0.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Limitations</h5>

<p>They are really identical to the ones present in version 0.96.7.</p>

<ul>
<li>DHT code is currently sub-optimal for firewalled hosts.</li>
<li>Manual bandwidth tuning is currently necessary to allow for efficient
  DHT usage.  Allow at least 8 Kib/s out, 15 KiB/s out being better.
  Also increase the lookup bandwidth to 32 KiB/s in and 6 KiB/s out, the
  defaults of 8 KiB/s in and 2 KiB/s out being very conservative.</li>
<li>DHT is enabled by default with a fixed (manually tunable) configuration.
  There is no auto-tuning and no adaptation to traffic conditions yet.
  You need to explicitly disable the DHT if you don't want to benefit from
  it.</li>
</ul>

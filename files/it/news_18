<h4>19. Oct 2002, Version 0.91 stable released</h4>
<p>
After nearly 3 months of development efforts, we are proud to present the
new 0.91 stable version. It features <em>many</em> changes since the latest
stable 0.90 release.  Among them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Now uses HTTP/1.1, which implies support for persistent connections.
<li>gtk-gnutella will now monitor whether we're connected to Internet and
  slow down its connection requests when it detects the connection was broken
  (after a delay of ~3 minutes at most).
<li>Download swarming is now supported: gtk-gnutella will download different
  portions of the same file from many hosts, as long as alternate sources
  are available.
<li>The download mesh (alternate source collection during downloads) is now
  used to fill the download queue with more sources.
<li>Alternate locations can also be passively collected from query hits.
  You can enable this in the swarming section on the download config pane.
<li>Download scheduling was entiretly redesigned to avoid hammering busy hosts
  and scale to 5000+ entries in the queue without slowing down the whole.
<li>Is now smart about the "push" flag and will try to ignore it if possible,
  in case the remote host wrongly set the flag but is not firewalled.
<li>gtk-gnutella now remembers the files it downloaded and will ignore further
  requests to download the same file.  It will visually mark those files, as
  well as the ones it already shares, by showing them in lighter color in the
  search results.
<li>It is possible to supply to gtk-gnutella your own ignore lists by SHA1 and
  by name/size but the feature is under-documented.
<li>Added an "expert mode".  Only when this is enabled will gtk-gnutella show
  the users some of the most complex settings.
<li>New Gnutella statistics pane, showing the packets we sent and received,
  how many we generated, and the reasons why we drop packets, by packet type.
<li>Now understands UTF-8 queries, but does not generate them.
<li>Fixed important bugs whereby all earlier versions of gtk-gnutella were
  unintentionally corrupting the Gnutella traffic!
<li>Moved away from the public hostcaches and now uses the Gnutella Web Cache.
<li>Will now show all upload attempts, not only the ones that are transferring.
  If the connection is aborted, the reason is also shown.
<li>New search stats types: queries by router, whole query.
  <ul>
	<li>"Queries by router" shows how many queries have been recieved
	from any node gtk-gnutella was directly connected to.
	<li>"Whole query" shows stats based on the complete query string
	instead of individual query words.
  </ul>
<li>New visual indications via icons in the status bar: whether gtk-gnutella
  is rebuilding the library, computing SHA1 of shared files in the background,
  and whether we are connected to Internet or not.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing the directory for incomplete/complete files, all 
  partially downloaded files recorded in ~/.gtk-gnutella/fileinfo 
  will still be downloaded to the old directory. You need to manually
  change the paths in above file using search/replace and your 
  favourite text editor.
<li>Sorting order of tables is not perserved across sessions.
<li>Marking/highlighting of results/downloads/uploads heavily depends
  on your GTK theme. Especially most themes do not set fg[ACTIVE] and 
  fg[NORMAL] to different values.
<li>There is currently no way to un-ignore a file via the gui. You 
  can however edit the done.sha1 and done.namesize files in your
  ~/.gtk-gnutella directory manually. Unignoring via gui is planned
  for the next release.
</ul>

<p>
We hope you will love this version.  We still believe gtk-gnutella is the
most advanced and efficient Gnutella servent available on Unix today.

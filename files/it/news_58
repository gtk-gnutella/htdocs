<h4>14 March 2011, Version 0.96.9 Released</h4>

<p>Version 0.96.9 is the stable yearly release.</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<ul>
<li>Added UPnP and NAT-PMP support.</li>
<li>Added a "log" command to the shell to manage logfiles.</li>
<li>Added --gdb-on-crash switch, auto-activated when no core dumps are
    possible.</li>
<li>Configures a crash directory as ~/.gtk-gnutella/crashes.</li>
<li>[GTK] Added visual feedback for UPnP and NAT-PMP configuration status.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Improvements</h5>

<ul>
<li>Better handling of uploading servers that also publish in the DHT.</li>
<li>Added Global Host Cache as a last-resort bootstrapping mechanism when UDP is
    not working.</li>
<li>Search results from firewalled hosts are now displayed in
    "dark slate gray"</li>
<li>Message statistics now include a line per DHT message type instead of
    aggregating all DHT messages in the same basket.</li>
<li>Always use ARC4 random number generator.</li>
<li>Continuous entropy collection to make the random number sequence more
    random.</li>
<li>Raised default ultrapeer connections in leaf mode to 4, maximum now
    being 5.</li>
<li>ASCII parentheses are no longer considered evil characters and are not
    stripped from filenames anymore.</li>
<li>Trailing spaces and periods are stripped from filenames because Windows
    does not like them.</li>
<li>When stdout and stderr are different files, critical messages (assertion
    failures, crashes) are duplicated to stdout.</li>
<li>[GTK] Added visual feedback icon for the DHT status.</li>
<li>[GTK] Show green/yellow/red uploading status icons indicating increasing
    warning levels after which we declare that uploads are stalling.</li>
<li>[GTK] Show DHT alt-loc queries on a per-file basis.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<ul>
<li>Prevented random crash at shutdown time (improper cleanup ordering).</li>
<li>Prevent crash when running on linux kernels patched with grsecurity.</li>
<li>Fixed improper hop count display (always showing 2147483647) in horizon
    stats.</li>
<li>Fixed bad GUI status for files: do not say "SHA1 failed" unless
    it's true.</li>
<li>Fixed message statistics which were reading payload size from the header
    instead of relying on what was actually read.</li>
<li>OOB proxying code was not considering MUID collisions, causing memory
    leaks.</li>
<li>Was not always reconnecting to other Gnutella nodes when missing slots.</li>
<li>Fixed old bug triggered by setting "listen_port" to 1 multiple times.</li>
<li>Magnets created from search results did not include push proxies.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Was not saving tree view column positions in the statistics pane.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Fixed broken DND so that files can be drag 'n' dropped from
    local searches and the download view to other desktop apps now.</li>
<li>[GTK] New users were never able to see the preset filters in the menu.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Under the Hood</h5>

<ul>
<li>Fresh bogus IP lists and geo IP database.</li>
<li>Updated SPAM detection rules.</li>
<li>Updated Gnutella bootstraping logic due to changing environments.</li>
<li>Cached DHT security tokens are now regularily expired.</li>
<li>Tuned DHT maintenance traffic down, using statistical methods to further
    avoid needless RPCs.</li>
<li>Clear empty databases at startup, attempt to shrink them otherwise.</li>
<li>Fixed uninitialized memory read detected by valgrind.</li>
<li>Made SDBM more robust when facing errors.</li>
<li>Errors encountered during SDBM operation are now reported at exit time.</li>
<li>If I/O errors were detected during operations of a persisted DB, request key
    checking at next startup.</li>
<li>Added CPU frequency scaling detection (Linux and Windows only) to be
    able to properly determine whether we are overloading the CPU.</li>
<li>Removed ShareMonkey URL support: they went out of business.</li>
<li>Use the DHT routing table as a source for new node addresses when the host
    caches are depleted, before attempting to contact the UHCs.</li>
<li>Throttle UDP pings so that we do not bombard a single host with many
    requests.</li>
<li>Limit Gnutella connection attempts to a given host to one per 2 minutes.</li>
<li>DHT routing table size now adjusts dynamically, lowering maintenance
    traffic.</li>
<li>Throttle received DHT lookups as a precaution against abuse from rogue
    nodes.</li>
<li>At startup time, sort cached host entries to put the most recent ones
    first.</li>
<li>Optimized QRP table merging loop.</li>
<li>Improved behaviour when facing stalling uploads.</li>
<li>Only send "DHT" in Gnutella pongs if the DHT runs in active mode.</li>
<li>Implemented DHT attack-prevention rules to guard against Sybil attacks.</li>
<li>Added arc4random() default implementation for systems without it.</li>
<li>Robustified query hit parsing so that we can filter out invalid hits.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Completely migrated GtkFileSelection to GtkFileChooser.</li>
</ul>

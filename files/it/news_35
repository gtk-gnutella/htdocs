<h4>12. January 2004, Bugfix release coming soon</h4>
<p>
	It is
  recommended that you either wait for this release or compile from the
  <a href="http://gtk-gnutella.sourceforge.net/pub/gtk-gnutella.tar.bz2">
    <strong>Official CVS snapshot</strong></a>, which should be at least as
  stable as the releases and has fixes for most of the known bugs.  If you want
  to help stamp out bugs for this release please read the 
  <a href="?page=bugreport_howto">Bug Report Howto</a>
  and report your bugs to the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gtk-gnutella/bugs/">
    Bug Tracker</a>.  I think it should be well worth the
  wait since there have been some very nice improvements to gtk-gnutella
  lately.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update 14.1.2004:</strong>
	We have problems finding a memory leak in the CVS  version
	of gtk-gnutella at the moment and need to do more testing which will probably
	delay the release of 0.93.3.

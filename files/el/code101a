	The downloaders always provided the header "User-Agent" and not "Server".
	Thus the wrong test in line 13 always overwrote the extracted useragent
	string from the "User-Agent" header with <code>NULL</code> because the "Server" header
	was not available.
</p>
<p>
	Line 13 should have read
</p>
<pre>
13: if (user_agent == NULL)
</pre>

	That bug was in CVS on 2004-01-17 in uploads.c line 2088.

	The <code>for</code>-loop iterates over <code>data_list</code> directly, instead
	of using a helper variable. Because of this at the end of the loop <code>data_list</code>
	points to <code>NULL</code>. Calling <code>g_list_free()</code> on <code>NULL</code>
	has exactly no effect and we don't even have a pointer to the list left at the
	end of the procedure.
</p>
<p>
	To fix the problem, I changed to code to use a helper variable to iterate over
	<code>data_list</code>, so that I still have the pointer to the beginning of the
	list in <code>data_list</code>.

	That bug was in CVS on 2004-01-17 in downloads_cb.c line 144. We had the same problem
	in a few other places too and we could measure a leak of about 1MB size after gtkg
	had been in regular usage for 3 hours.<br>

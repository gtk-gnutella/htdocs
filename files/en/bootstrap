<h1>Bootstrapping</h1>

<h2>Joining the Gnutella network</h2>
<p>
Initially, when you start gtk-gnutella for the first time, it doesn't know any other
peers at all. The process of joining the Gnutella network by discovering peers
is called bootstrapping. This can be achieved automagically or manually.
Actually, if you haven't used gtk-gnutella for a couple of days, it may not know
any connectible peers anymore and it has to bootstrap again. By using gtk-gnutella
daily, this can be avoided.
</p>

<h2>Automagic bootstrapping</h2>
<p>
Normally, when using a recent stable release, gtk-gnutella will bootstrap
automagically using UDP host caches.  That means you don't have anything to do
other than waiting a moment until gtk-gnutella has found a number of peers and
is connected to them. The "Network" shows you whether gtk-gnutella is connected
to any peers, trying to connect or just a sitting duck. Ignore the one or two
"Pseudo UDP nodes". They are called so because that's your own peer.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, under some circumstances this won't work. Some potential reasons
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your version of gtk-gnutella is older than a year.</li>
<li>Your firewall rules are too strict.</li>
<li>You cannot use UDP at all.</li>
<li>The known bootstrap servers are dead and gone or just out-of-order.</li>
<li>You have bad luck.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manual bootstrapping</h2>
<p>
Fortunately, the Gnutella network is fully distributed and well-known bootstrap servers
are only an convenience but not a requirement for connecting to the public network. All
you need is to find at least one well-connected peer.
</p>

<h3>A friend using Gnutella is a friend indeed</h3>
<p>
For example, you can simply ask
your friends who are also using Gnutella - it doesn't have to be gtk-gnutella - and
connect to their peers. You only need to know the IP address and port.
</p>

<h3>A public server is fine, too</h3>
<p>
Last but not least, there are also public servers, also known as
GWebCaches. Originally, these were used automagically but this caused a
lot of intended and unintended abuse. Most of them are extinct by now.
Nonetheless, it is usually possible to visit them using any web browser to
discover some fresh peer addresses for joining the gnutella network manually.
GWebCaches can be found <a

GWebCaches are hostile and provided by well-known spammers.

<h3>Adding a peer using the GUI</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
A peer is manually added by entering its address at the "Network" tab. Always
use copy and paste or drag and drop to avoid typing mistakes. Of course,
you can also use hostnames instead of IP addresses and a comma-seperated
list of multiple addresses.
</p>

<h3>Adding a peer using the shell interface</h3>
<p>
Peers can also be added by using the shell interface:
</p>
<pre>
echo node add 127.1.2.3:38359 | gtk-gnutella --shell
</pre>

<!-- end bootstrap -->
<!-- vi: set et ts=2 sw=2: -->

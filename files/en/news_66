<h4>11 November 2012, Version 0.98.4 Released</h4>

<p>This is an important release correcting severe bugs affecting the overall
   wealth of the system: the PARQ upload queue was not properly restored, the
   DHT was not always sending correct values back (resulting in failed lookups),
   and SDBM (our hash-on-disk database) had two well-hidden bugs that could
   cause crashes at startup or that compromised regular runtime
   operations.</p>

<p>This release also introduces an interesting improvement: we are now using
   a reliable UDP layer to transfer out-of-band query hits, ensuring that these
   important messages are properly sent and received and never lost.</p>

<p>The SPAM-detection on query hits received via UDP was too eager to discard
   results from perfectly valid sources, causing improper loss of results from
   your queries.</p>

<p>We were also wrongly sending out more queries than necessary: a
   long-standing bug caused locally-issued OOB-proxied queries to be re-emitted
   a second time, and we were re-forwarding duplicate queries (received with
   higher TTL than before) to all the leaves. Although not harmful, these two
   bugs were wasting some of the outgoing bandwidth when running as a ultra
   node.</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<li>Plugged support for "OOB Proxy Veto".</li>

<h4>11. May 2002, Gtk-Gnutella supports traffic compression</h4>
<p>
Today Raphael completed the first implementation of the gtk-gntuella
traffic compression stack. The whole thing is brand new and compression
is not yet tested very much and will still have it's edges. But the more
people get the code from CVS and file bug reports, the faster it will be stable.

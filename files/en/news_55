<h4>29 March 2009, Version 0.96.6 Released</h4>

<p>Version 0.96.6 is a stable release. The list below shows the most important
bug fixed and improvements since the previous release.</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<ul>
<li>#1932909 "columns in search window do not scale properly".</li>
<li>Fixed improper HTTP chunking when outputing chunks larger than 64 KiB.</li>
<li>#2628899 "tries to download from my old self after IP changes".</li>
<li>Was not always resuming the interrupted SHA-1 computation of a finished file
	when servent was closed in the middle of processing.</li>
<li>Fixed bad range checking test in the download part.</li>
<li>Was not paying attention to the "give_server_hostname" property and instead
	sent "HNAME" GGEP extensions in query hits provided a non-empty name was
	defined as the "server_hostname".</li>
<li>Fixed improper upload slot counting which introduced race conditions,
	sometimes leading to having more slots used than the configured maximum
	(in addition to the "quick" upload slots).</li>
<li>Prevent occasional crashes at shutdown time, during subsystem cleanups.</li>
<li>Fixed corner cases where we could lose a server hostname and downright bug
	where we discarded the hostname after a DNS lookup if the subsequent
	connection attempt did not succeed.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Improvements</h5>

<ul>
<li>Refuse to share certain directories: /, $HOME, $GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR, and
	the incomplete and corrupted directories.</li>
<li>Downloads GUI: added checkboxes to invert the select/filter patterns.</li>
<li>Downloads GUI: added "Modified" column and detail showing the timestamp of
	the last file modification.</li>
<li>Optional beautification operations on filenames: strip leading "-", remove
	consecutive "_" and prevent "_" surrounding punctuation characters.</li>
<li>Fixed significant performance issue in the Gtk+ 1.2 front-end: update of
	upload statistics was O(n) but is now O(1).</li>
<li>Background TTH file verification now lights an icon in the GUI.</li>
<li>Show TTH tree depth in the download "Details" pane.</li>
<li>Update the bitzi metadata info box when a query finishes, so that it is
	not required to click on the result again after requesting bitzi data.</li>
<li>Added MIME type column for search results.</li>
<li>Added "Last Request" and "Last Upload" columns to the Upload History.</li>
<li>Almost complete DHT support (missing only publishing of data), but code
	needs to be explicitly enabled by setting "enable_dht" to TRUE.  The DHT
	knows how to look for alt-locs for files and push-proxies for firewalled
	hosts, and will store local data for others to query.</li>
<li>New shell commands "stats", "download", "echo".</li>
<li>It is now possible to rename files being downloaded (through GTK2 or shell,
	no support in GTK1).</li>
<li>Added more filename extensions to the built-in search filters.</li>
<li>Switch resources after getting an HTTP error if the connection is kept alive
	and the error permits follow-ups (non-busy conditions).</li>
<li>Improved ability to switch resources after file completion by ignoring
	trailing swarming data, to keep the connection alive.</li>
<li>Bitzi tickets are refreshed when explicitely requested, avoiding reuse
	of stale metadata.</li>
<li>Completed files are displayed during hash verification.</li>
<li>Only propagate good alt-locs for files we are downloading, i.e. addresses
	of hosts which we know to be serving that file because we contacted them.<li>
<li>Many new statistics counters.</li>
<li>Allow scheduling of special downloads without considering per-host limits,
	as these are of a much shorter duration (THEX and browse host requests).</li>
<li>Always seed completed files, regardless of their size (no PFSP minimum as
	with partial files), when their SHA-1 has been verified.</li>
<li>Incorrectly encoded Bitzi metadata is translated to Unicode.</li>
<li>Browse-host responses are sorted alphanumerically on relative pathnames to
	allow users to relate files together if they don't understand GGEP "PATH".
	</li>
<li>Improved routing of PUSH messages by also looking whether targetted hosts
	happen to be one of our immediate neighbours.</li>
<li>Updated Norwegian Bokmal and Spanish translations.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Under the hood</h5>

<ul>
<li>Parse legacy Shareaza THEX URIs "urn:tree:tiger/:" (extra "/" here).</li>
<li>Handle non-standard  X-Thex-URI headers if peer provides a valid
	X-Content-URN header (Shareaza 2.1.0.0).</li>
<li>Also attempt to give priority to the last "pfsp_last_chunk" bytes of
	downloaded files, since that can contain important indexing information to
	enable pre-view of partial video files.</li>
<li>More MIME types known (derived from file extensions).</li>
<li>Can now download THEX data at a tree depth of 11 for files larger than 1
	GiB.</li>
<li>Can download sub-optimal THEX data, as non-optimal data is better than none,
	but keeps looking for THEX data at the optimal tree depth nonetheless.</li>
<li>Reimplemented scanning of shared directories as a background task so that
	the process (not just the GUI) is fully responsive during the whole scan.
	</li>
<li>Let the background task scheduler compute the proper amount of ticks to
	use for each task.</li>
<li>Upload statistics now record the file's SHA-1, so that we can consolidate
	partial file sharing with library sharing statistics, with the filename
	being forced to the library's filename.</li>
<li>Avoid starting moving a completed file if there is not enough space on
	the targetted file system.</li>
<li>Recognize and propagate the "DHT" GGEP extension in pongs.</li>
<li>Added support for "DHTIPP" GGEP extension in pings, used for DHT bootstrap.
	</li>
<li>Added more entropy to the random number seed.</li>
<li>Plugged a few memory leaks.</li>
<li>No longer send SHA-1 queries on the Gnutella network. They are now performed
	through the DHT, which has the suitable topology to do so efficiently.</li>
<li>Fixed UDP bandwidth computation, and removed any limit on UDP incoming.</li>
<li>Updated list of hostile IP adress ranges, Geo-IP data, spam patterns and
	spam samples.</li>
<li>Property loading from files was in O(n*n), made it O(n).</li>
<li>Now detect property files being blindly copied over from another
	gtk-gnutella's config directory and reset properties whose value needs to
	be unique.</li>
<li>The GUID and the KUID (Kademlia ID, the DHT node ID) were made sticky.</li>
<li>Optimization of QRP lookups in tables ranging from 16k to 2M slots.</li>
<li>Limit amount of hits to 10 per query hit packet, as LimeWire chokes
	otherwise.</li>
<li>Limit amount of alt-locs in hits to 10 or LimeWire chokes.</li>
<li>Keep connection alive when reporting an HTTP error to allow remote resource
	switching if necessary.</li>
<li>Emit and parse new X-Downloaded header, apparently introduced by LimeWire.
	</li>
<li>Added parsing of X-FW-Node-Info headers to grab push-proxies from firewalled
	hosts, as well as gather the proper GUID and host address/port.</li>
<li>Emit X-FW-Node-Info if node is firewalled but continue to list our
	push-proxies in the standard X-Push-Proxies header.</li>
<li>Avoid endless aggressive chunk splitting during swarming.</li>
<li>Proper parsing of comma-separated values in Accept and other Accept-Encoding
	HTTP headers.</li>
<li>Reject UDP packets from unspecified addresses.</li>
<li>Drain more data out of the UDP receive buffer to prevent it from filling up.
	</li>
<li>Strip at most 5 trailing characters from words when building the QRP table,
	thereby inserting less radices and making the table more sparse.</li>
<li>Removed workarounds for dealing with broken 0.96.2 nodes and earlier 0.95.x.
	</li>
<li>Extended syntax for push:// exact sources in magnets to be able to supply
	all the known push-proxies, even if that is an empty set.  Since downloads
	are persisted as magnets, this also allows keeping all the previously
	known push-proxies accross sessions.</li>
<li>Upgraded PARQ to version 1.1 (mostly specification cleanups).</li>
<li>Added additional anti-hammering for cases where many files on the same
	server are queued and gtk-gnutella is configured to launch more than 1
	connection per IP.  Connection attempts to the same server are now limited
	to 5 per minute.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Limitations</h5>

<ul>
<li>DHT code is still experimental, although functional: configuration of
	parameters can only be done through the shell, and there is no support
	for publishing yet.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Integrity checks for the source tarball</h5>

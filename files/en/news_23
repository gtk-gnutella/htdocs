<h4>8. Feb 2003, Version 0.92 beta released</h4>
<p>
We are proud to release the beta version of our upcoming 0.92 release. It features many changes,
so please test it as thoroughly as possible and report any bugs to the IRC channel or the mailing lists :)
<ul> 
<li> Now supports Ultrapeers, which means GTKG can work as an ultra node or as
  a leaf node.  You can still run as a normal node, although this is not
  something wise to do, because that will likely relagate you in a small part
  of the Gnutella network.
<li> The GTK2 front-end is no longer experimental, albeit it is slower than
  the GTK1.2 front-end.  This is due to the somewhat inefficient
  implementation of the underlying GTK library.  Don't use GTK2 unless you
  have the equivalent of a 1 GHz Intel chip.
<li> Added client-side PFSP support (partial file sharing). GTKG can download
  from servers holding partial files.
<li> Added client-side PARQ support (Passive / Active Remote Queuing).  GTKG
  can now queue downloads from either active-queuing servers or PARQ.
<li> New Gnet statistics: flow-controlled packets per TTL and hops.
<li> The "Type" column in the Gnet connection pane was turned into "Flags".
<li> Added support for GGEP in pings/pongs/pushes: those packets are now
  accepted and forwarded to connections advertising GGEP support.
<li> New "use surplus bandwidth" setting: all unused bandwidth for Gnet or HTTP
  can be stolen by the other in case it needs some.
<li> Added count for total bytes uploaded and downloaded.
<li> Added support for vendor-specific messages.
<li> The "prefer compressed connections" settings no longer works as expected
  when running in non-normal mode.
<li> New hops-flow support: remote flow-controlled connections can now warn us
  that thye are flow-controlling us, and so we can drop queries immediately
  instead of sending them, saving outgoing bandwidth.
<li> Will now show the GTKG version in query hits.
<li> The queue now shows the count of alive downloads, as well as the queue count.
  An "alive" download is an entry for which the remote server replies.
<li> Changed the connection algorithm: will now attempt to connect to more
  nodes than really configured, dropping the surplus connections later, when
  needed at all.
</ul>

<h4>20. July 2003, Version 0.92.1 candidate released</h4>
<p>
  Please test this candidate so we can provide a very stable 0.92.1 in a few 
  weeks. It should be very stable and just as fine as a release. Due to some 
  problems with the toolchain, it's a source-only release. 
</p>

  Here are the checksums:

    SHA1 (gtk-gnutella-0.92.1c.tar.bz2) = 41ea9104b4fe407139005d60d689a7bde044ebd7

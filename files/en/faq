<p>
  This means that gtk-gnutella has that file recorded as complete in its 
  fileinfo database. This database is usually located in 
  ~/.gtk-gnutella/fileinfo. At the moment there is no way to remove or
  modify an entry of that database from the gui, but you can edit the file
  with any text editor while gtk-gnutella is not running.

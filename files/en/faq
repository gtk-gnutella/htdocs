<h2>Gnutella connections</h2>

<h3><a name="gnet0">What is a good number of connections?</a></h3>
<p>
  A good number is 4/5 (minimum/maximum). You can calculate a bandwidth
  consumption of 1kb/s per connection. You should never use up all your
  bandwidth with those. Especially on an asymetric cable/DSL connection you
  can easily starve your incoming traffic by producing too much outgoing 
  traffic (TCP/IP issue). Use at most half of your outgoing bandwidth with
  gNet connections. E.g. on a line with 128kbit/s upstream set up at most
  8 connections.<br>
  The bandwidth control settings will help you further finetuning gtk-gnutella's
  bandwidth usage.
</p>

<h3><a name="gnet1">Do I need to forward a port on my firewall?</a></h3>
<p>
  You don't need to forward any port for gtk-gnutella to work, but it
  will perform much better if you do. If gtk-gnutella thinks you are firewalled,
  it will not show any <a href="#down3">"push"</a> results since you wouldn't be
  able to download those anyway.<br>
  Even people can not connect directly to you, they can still download files from
  your node using a <a href="#down3">push request</a>.<br>
  You can configure the port gtk-gnutella listens on. The setting "listen port" is 
  located on the "Network settings" tab on the config page.
</p>


<h2>Searches</h2>

<h3><a name="search0">How can I get more results?</a></h3>
<p>
  The number of results you get depends heavily on wether people are able to
  connect to you (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>)
  and on the <a href="#gnet0">number of connections</a> to other hosts.
</p>



<h2>Downloads</h2>

<h3><a name="down0">What does the status "ignore by [SHA1|name & size]" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  This means that gtk-gnutella has that file recorded as complete in its 
  fileinfo database. This database is usually located in 
  ~/.gtk-gnutella/fileinfo. At the moment there is no way to remove or
  modify an entry of that database from the gui, but you can edit the file
  with any text editor while gtk-gnutella is not running. 
</p>

<h3><a name="down1">What does the status "No URN on server" mean?</a></h3>
<p>
  This means that gtk-gnutella wants to download a new file from a host, but 
  that host does not provide a SHA1 hash for the file. Since the file is new
  (not yet partially downloaded), gtk-gnutella can not do an overlap check to
  verify that the file on the host is really the file you want. In such a case
  it relies on the SHA1 provided by the remote host, but if no SHA1 is supplied,
  then gtk-gnutella has no way of assuring that the file it wants to download
  and the file on the remote server are really the same.<br> 
  If you get annoyed by those messages you can activate the "optimistic first 
  chunk" option on the "download settings" tab in the config page.
</p>

<h3><a name="down6">Why is the same file downloaded X times?</a></h3>
<p>
  Check the "Range" column. This is called <a href="#down4">swarming</a>.
  Gtk-gnutella tries to get the file in <a href"#down2">chunks</a> and will
  get it from multiple hosts in parallel if possible.
</p>

<h3><a name="down4">What is "swarming"?</a></h3>
<p>
  Swarming describes the ability to download a single file from multiple hosts
  in parallel. Gtk-gnutella will automatically try to find additional sources
  for any queued file using the <a href="#down5">download mesh</a> and by
  monitoring routed results.
</p>

<h3><a name="down2">What is a "chunk"?</a></h3>
<p>
  A chunk is another word for "part of a file". When gtk-gnutella runs in
  <a href="#down4">swarming mode</a> it will retrieve multiple chunks of a
  downloading file until it has downloaded the complete file. The "Range"
  column shows you which chunk you are currently downloading.
</p>

<h3><a name="down5">What is the "download mesh"?</a></h3>
<p>
  When you download a file from a host that supports the download mesh,
  it will tell you about additional sources for the requested file
  (provided it know any). Those will then be used for
  <a href="#down4">swarming</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="down3">What is a "push request"?</a></h3>
<p>
  The "push request" is a facility to download files from hosts you can
  not connect to directly (because they are firewalled). Well, you can 
  not connect to those hosts, but they probably can connect to you. To
  tell a remote host to connect to your host so that you can download
  a file from the remote host you send a push request to it.<br>
  You can't make use the the push requests when you are behind a firewall
  (see <a href="#gnet1">port forwarding</a>).

  More packages coming soon.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>These are some of the changes made since 0.93 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Simplified the GUI for non-experts.  Beginners will now see less curious 
    things on the screen, until they become more acquainted and turn on 
    "expert" mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many improvements in the GUI:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Gnutella node information displayed can now be configured in 
        detail, and is by default reduced to four statistics only.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible to hide the handshaking version and the Uptime column 
        from the Gnutella pane.
      </li>
      <li>
        When running in auto mode, show the criteria for becoming an ultranode.
      </li>
      <li>
        The leaf node bandwidth odometers are by default automatically hidden 
        when running as a leaf node.
      </li>
      <li>
        GUI refreshing has been optimized so we don't unnecessarily refresh 
        screens that the user is not looking at.  The downside is that when 
        moving to that screen, stale data is presented for about 1 second 
        until the refreshing takes place.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    0.93 was not reporting uploaded partial files as such to downloading peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control "shell" is now compiled in by default but needs to be 
    explicitly enabled in the GUI to become operational.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved connectivity between ultrapeers to avoid frequent disconnection 
    due to "activity timeout".
  </li>
  <li>
    Bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Was misparsing query hits bearing alt-locs attached to each hit, 
        causing GTKG to possibly drop those hits and close the connection when 
        coming from an immediate neighbour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When restarting a search from menu, re-enable it automatically if it 
        was disabled (fixes bug #864348).
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon restart, a disabled search will now be shown in gray in the 
        search list (fixes bug #857972) -- feature only implemented for GTK1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Many other little changes that we'll let you discover...
  </li>
</ul>

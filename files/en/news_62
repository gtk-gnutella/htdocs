<h4>11 December 2011, Version 0.98 Released</h4>

<p>This is a major release, adding "IPv6-Ready" features. It also fixes
   long-lasting bugs in various areas and contains some other low-level
   improvements.</p>

<p>During the building of this release, Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie passed
   away. Gtk-gnutella would not exist in its current form without the earlier
   work of Dennis, the co-inventor of C. This release is dedicated to the memory
   of that great computer scientist. Farewell, Dennis!</p>

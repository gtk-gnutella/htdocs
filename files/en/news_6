<h4>12. January 2002, Lots of Major Changes in CVS</h4>
<p>
Much of the underlying code has been changed and brought up to date
with newer versions of the Gnutella protocol (e.g. 0.6 handshaking support),
although the GUI still looks pretty the same as before. Everyone should try
it out (see our <a href="?page=devel">Development</a>
page about CVS) in order to catch those hidden bugs.<br>
It's planned to release a 1.0 version soon and then to begin working on
a completely new core and GUI, with a total separation of the two parts
which will allow for different GUIs (think kde, ncurses, etc.) to work
with the gnutella core of Gtk-Gnutella.

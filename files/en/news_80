<h4>11 November 2016, Version 1.1.11 Released</h4>

<p>This release fixes a portability issue on FreeBSD and introduces a main
   core feature and minor new GUI features.</p>

<p>The main feature is the additiona of "equivalence classes" defining word
   aliases, used when sharing files and querying for them.</p>

<p>Currently, the only supported equivalence class deals with naming of
   series. Indeed, there are various conventions that can be used to represent
   these, and it makes searching inefficient: either one will lookup for all the
   possible variations, or one will miss some of the files.</p>

<p>For instance, episode #8 of an hypothetical season #4 can be represented
   by any of these strings:</p>

<pre>
	{ "s04e08", "4x08", "408", "04x08", "0408" }
</pre>

<p>Thanks to the equivalence class, a file bearing one of these strings can
   be searched for (and located successfully) by using any of the other strings.
   Of course, since this is a local processing, the more servents out there are
   deployed with this aliasing support, the more efficient the feature
   becomes!</p>

<p>There are also new GUI features: the "Clear completed" button from the
   Download pane is now doing someething useful, and the current page of
   different notebooks is remembered across sessions. The only one which is not
   restored on normal resuming is the main notebook tab. It will be restored if
   GTKG is restarted after a crash, but otherwise the application will always
   start up within the Network tab.</p>

<p>In the Uploads tab, upload requests coming from a G2 servent will not be
   flagged with a "[G2]" tab right after the IP address. This helps seeing how
   the Gnutella and G2 network unification is evolving.</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>
<ul>
<li>Flag uploads coming from G2 servents with a "[G2]" tag after IP
    address.</li>
<li>Added alias support in sharing/querying.</li>
<li>Made the "Clear completed" button in Downloads/Tools do something
    useful.</li>
<li>Moved "Clear completed" button to the bottom right of the download
    pane.</li>
<li>Remember fileinfo notebook tab number across sessions.</li>
<li>Remember main notebook tab number across sessions, only restored after
    crash.</li>
<li>Remember Gnet stats notebook tab number across sessions.</li>
<li>Remember download info / tools notebook tab number across sessions.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Added --cleanup to explicitly request for final memory cleanup
    sequence.</li>
<li>Updated Italian translation.</li>
<li>Updated GeoIP databases.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Leaf nodes could end-up being connected to more ultrapeers than
    configured.</li>
<li>Fixed monitoring of alien threads, important when GTK file selector is
    used.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>Debian compatibility level changed from 4 to 5.</li>
<li>Make sure we can deal with older pkg-config, which needs leading
    arguments.</li>
<li>Use "embedded" symbols for <code>xmalloc()</code>, <code>xfree()</code>
    and friends.</li>
<li>Added "query_trace" property to trace all queries which were
    searched.</li>
<li>Moved halloc-based string functions like <code>h_strdup()</code> to
    dedicated hstrfn.c.</li>
<li>Expanded search mask to 64 bits to be able to hold all digits and
    letters.</li>
<li>Count aliased queries and hits from aliases.</li>
<li>Pre-compute shared file media type at record creation time.</li>
<li>Pass query limits to <code>st_search()</code> to avoid needless pattern
    matching.</li>
<li>Added <code>h_strsplit()</code> and <code>h_strsplit_set()</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>strvec_append_with()</code> to expand vector by appending
    another vector.</li>
<li><code>crash_assert_logv()</code>: don't call <code>crash_mode()</code> if
    assert failure was recorded.</li>
<li><code>entropy_clock_time()</code>: mix the entropy nonce through hashing
    for more diffusion.</li>
<li><code>node_can_accept_connection()</code>: only send headers back when
    handshaking.</li>
<li><code>qrp_add_file()</code>: optimized to avoid computing word length if
    not required.</li>
<li><code>thread_stack_check_overflow()</code>: ignore virtual addresses
    outside stack range.</li>
<li><code>vmm_init_once()</code>: ensure any shared library for stacktrace
    unwinding is loaded.</li>

</ul>

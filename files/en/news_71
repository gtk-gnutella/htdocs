<h4>21 March 2015, Version 1.1.2 Released</h4>

<p>This is mainly a bug-fixing release, addressing rare crashes that have
   been happening in production. It also contains several improvements.</p>

<p>It fixes a user-reported bug whreby it was not possible to properly
   configure the download paths using the GUI -- that led to application crashes
   due to the incomplete support for discovered threads (which GTK is using
   underneath to manage the dialog box).</p>

<p>Another bug was caused by the HTTP header parsing logic which did not
   allow "." in header names. That made it refuse to parse headers sent by some
   UPnP devices, such as "BOOTID.UPNP.ORG" or "CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG", prevening
   UPnP mappings from being installed.</p>

<p>Hapening rarely but still annoying, there was a bug on the error handling
   path of write errors to the TX network stack, leading to assertion failures
   in the <tt>mq_tcp_putq()</tt> routine. That was because the
   <tt>qrt_compressed()</tt> routine was not handling task cancellation
   properly. The likelyhood of hitting that bug when running as a leaf node was
   very low.</p>

<p>On the improvement side, the search list is now highlighting searches for
   which we have associated downloads by displaying the text in green. Further
   tweaks were made to our GTK2 code to make sure the changes are reported "real
   time" when the state changes, which was not always the case before (one
   needed to go over a search by explicitly clicking on it to update the display
   in the search list).</p>

<p>The SHA1 computation code was also further optimized to be as fast as
   possible, reducing file hashing time by two! Since SHA1 hashing happens
   regularily in gtk-gnutella to collect entropy, optimizing the SHA1
   computation affects more than just file verification.</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>[GTK2] Added translation URL in the "About" GUI dialog.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Highlight searches with registered downloads by using green
    text.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Added tri-state column sorting to the "upload history" panel.</li>
<li>FAQ: added new entry explaining how to get the magnet of a shared
    file.</li>
<li>Map the "collection" G2 query tag to the Windows / Linux "archive" file
    set.</li>
<li>Map the "torrent" G2 query tag to the "torrent" file set.</li>
<li>Added support for "rom", "wordprocessing" and "subtitle" G2 query media
    types.</li>
<li>Further optimized SHA1 computation, now going about twice faster for
    files.</li>

<h4>19. January 2002, 0.80-beta1 Released</h4>
<p>
There are many many <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=70774">changes</a> (see last weeks news), including search result filtering, support
of the 0.6 handshaking protocol and a reduction of the bandwidth used through the implementation
of a new ping/pong method.<br>
Once the remaining important changes are implemented we will release a 0.90 version, which
means <i>feature freeze</i>! So please check back often, test the CVS development version
and report all bugs you may find.

<h4>23. March 2002, Version 0.85-beta1 Is Out</h4>
<p>
Gtk-Gnutella 0.85-beta1 has been released. As I've written in last weeks news
there are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=580453&amp;forum_id=5943">many
changes</a> which make it really worth upgrading.<br>
A short note about beta and CVS releases: the developers are really cautious
about not adding new bugs or instability to the program, so in general
the current CVS version or a beta release are as stable as real releases.
The only difference between CVS/beta releases and a normal release is that
the feature list for the next release isn't complete, and that a release
candidate must be tested before release to be really sure that there are
no bugs and instabilities.

<h4>15. June 2003, Version 0.92 released</h4>
<p>
You can get this new version from our download section.
Here are the changes since 0.91.1, the latest stable release:

<ul>
<li> Now supports Ultrapeers, which means GTKG can work as an ultra node or as
  a leaf node.  You can still run as a normal node, although this is not
  something wise to do, because that will likely relagate you to a small part
  of the Gnutella network.
<li> New icons for showing node state (leaf or ultra mode).
<li> The GTK2 front-end is no longer experimental, albeit it is slower than
  the GTK1.2 front-end.  This is due to the somewhat inefficient
  implementation of the underlying GTK library.  Don't use GTK2 unless you
  have the equivalent of a 1 GHz Intel chip.
<li> Added client-side PFSP support (partial file sharing). GTKG can download
  from servers holding partial files.
<li> Added full PARQ support (Passive / Active Remote Queuing), both for upload
  and downloads.
<li> New Gnet statistics: flow-controlled packets per TTL and hops.
<li> The "Type" column in the Gnet connection pane was turned into "Flags".
<li> Added support for GGEP in pings/pongs/pushes: those packets are now
  accepted and forwarded to connections advertising GGEP support.
<li> New "use surplus bandwidth" setting: all unused bandwidth for Gnet or HTTP
  can be stolen by the other in case it needs some.
<li> Added count for total bytes uploaded and downloaded.
<li> Added support for vendor-specific messages.
<li> New hops-flow support: remote flow-controlled connections can now warn us
  that they are flow-controlling us, and so we can drop queries immediately
  instead of sending them, saving outgoing bandwidth.
<li> Will now show the GTKG version in query hits.
<li> The queue now shows the count of alive downloads, as well as the queue count.
  An "alive" download is an entry for which the remote server replies.
<li> Changed the connection algorithm: will now attempt to connect to more
  nodes than really configured, dropping the surplus connections later, when
  needed at all.
<li> Filters out hostile IP addresses.
<li> New "fileinfo" pane in the download screen.  Not finished, but will show
  the currently registered downloads and their status.
<li> Domain name resolution for Gnutella web cache are now done asynchronously.
  The GUI will no longer freeze due to a DNS request.
<li> Some performance improvements: removed the most important bottlenecks.

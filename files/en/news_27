<h4>15. June 2003, Version 0.92 released</h4>
<p>
  You can get this new version from our download section.  Here are the 
  changes since 0.91.1, the latest stable release:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now supports Ultrapeers, which means GTKG can work as an ultra node or as
    a leaf node.  You can still run as a normal node, although this is not
    something wise to do, because that will likely relegate you to a small 
    part of the Gnutella network.
  </li>
  <li>
    New icons for showing node state (leaf or ultra mode).
  </li>
  <li>
    The GTK2 front-end is no longer experimental, albeit it is slower than
    the GTK1.2 front-end.  This is due to the somewhat inefficient
    implementation of the underlying GTK library.  Don't use GTK2 unless you
    have the equivalent of a 1 GHz Intel chip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added client-side PFSP support (partial file sharing). GTKG can download
    from servers holding partial files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added full PARQ support (Passive / Active Remote Queuing), both for 
    upload and downloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    New Gnet statistics: flow-controlled packets per TTL and hops.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Type" column in the Gnet connection pane was turned into "Flags".
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for GGEP in pings/pongs/pushes: those packets are now
    accepted and forwarded to connections advertising GGEP support.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "use surplus bandwidth" setting: all unused bandwidth for Gnet or 
    HTTP can be stolen by the other in case it needs some.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added count for total bytes uploaded and downloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for vendor-specific messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    New hops-flow support: remote flow-controlled connections can now warn 
    us that they are flow-controlling us, and so we can drop queries 
    immediately instead of sending them, saving outgoing bandwidth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now show the GTKG version in query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    The queue now shows the count of alive downloads, as well as the queue 
    count.  An "alive" download is an entry for which the remote server 
    replies.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed the connection algorithm: will now attempt to connect to more
    nodes than really configured, dropping the surplus connections later, 
    when needed at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    Filters out hostile IP addresses.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "Fileinfo" pane in the download screen.  Not finished, but will show
    the currently registered downloads and their status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Domain name resolution for Gnutella web cache are now done 
    asynchronously.  The GUI will no longer freeze due to a DNS request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some performance improvements: removed the most important bottlenecks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>12 January 2004, Bugfix release coming soon</h4>
<p>
  Some serious bugs have been found in 0.93.1 and 0.93.2.  A feature freeze is 
  in place and a bugfix 0.93.3 release is expected in a week or so.  It is 
  recommended that you either wait for this release or compile from the 
  <a href="http://gtk-gnutella.sourceforge.net/pub/gtk-gnutella-current.tar.bz2">
    <strong>Official CVS snapshot</strong></a>, which should be at least as 
  stable as the releases and has fixes for most of the known bugs.  If you want 
  to help stamp out bugs for this release please read the 
  <a href="<?php echo BASEURL ?>?page=bugreport_howto"> Bug Report Howto</a> 
  and report your bugs to the 
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=104467&amp;group_id=4467&amp;func=browse">
    Bug Tracker</a>.  I think it should be well worth the 
  wait since there have been some very nice improvements to gtk-gnutella 
  lately.

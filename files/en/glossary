<h1>Glossary</h1>

<p>
	This glossary derives from the old <a href="/manual/">Online Manual</a>. More terms are being included.
</p>

<div class="glossary_capital">G</div>

<div class="glossary_term" name="G2hub">G2 Hub</div>

<p>
	G2 Hubs in Gnutella2 network are equivalent to <a href="ultrapper">Ultrappers</a> in <a href="GnutellaNet">GnutellaNet</a>. 
	GTK-Gnutella usually connects to 2 G2 Hubs behaving as a <a href="leaf">leaf node</a> on Gnutella2 network.
</p>

<div class="glossary_term" name="GnutellaNet">GnutellaNet</div>

<p>
	The GnutellaNet is an <em>overlay</em> network. This means it is a network that sits on top of the normal internet. 
	GnutellaNet is <em>unstructured</em>. This just means that no particular computer or group of computers controls
	GnutellaNet; it is probably more democratic than most governments.
</p>
<p>
	As the GnutellaNet is an overlay network, it doesn't have to pay
	attention to geography.  It is likely that you will connect to
	computers in other countries. Things might be faster if this was not
	the case. However, they may also be more resilient in the current form.
</p>


<div class="glossary_capital">L</div>

<div class="glossary_term" name="leaf">Leaf node</div>

<p>
	A leaf is the basic connection to the GnutellaNet. A leaf typically connects to three or four <a href="#ultrapeer">ultrapeers</a>. The ultrapeers
	route searches and keep their leaves connected to the GnutellaNet.
</p>


<div class="glossary_capital">S</div>

<div class="glossary_term" name="search_literals">search literals</div>

<p>
	Double and single quotes can be used so that an entire search term
	will be matched instead of individual words.  Quoting maybe necessary
	if you wish to search for a phrase with special characters such as the
	<a href="#search_required">plus and minus signs</a>.
</p>

<div class="glossary_term" name="search_prefixes">search prefixes</div>

<ol>
<li>
	browse: List shared files on the specified host. The format is "browse:<em>ip_address:port</em>".
	Many portions of the GUI have a menu option, available from a right
	click, that will browser the specified computer.
</li>
<li>
	http: Download the specified web page. This could be a zip file, a movie, large JPEG, etc.
</li>
<li>
	local: Search results from the local host. Ie, your computer. A
     regular expression may follow to filter the results. For
     example, "local:manual" will show all files you share with
     manual in the file name.
</li>
<li>
	magnet: Search and download the magnet target.
</li>
<li>
	push: The format of this search is "push:<em>guid:ip_address:port/path_to_file</em>".
	The <em>guid</em> is the Gnutella ID of the computer that has the file of interest.
	The <em>ip:port</em> is the push proxy that the <em>guid</em> is connected to. 
	Typically this would be an ultrapeer that will allow a proxy download. 
	The <em>guid</em> is a 32 hexadecimal characters.
</li>
<li>
	sha1: A base64 SHA value to search for. It is not automatically downloaded.
</li>
<li>
	urn: Similar to a sha1 search, but the hash value is specified. Ie, urn:sha1:<em>hash value</em>
</li>

<div class="glossary_term" name="search_required">search requireds</div>

<p>
	Mini filters are created with the '+' and '-' signs. The plus sign
	requires that a word is part of the results. The minus sign doesn't
	display any results with the given phrase. The plus and minus signs
	can be used to select ambigious terms.
</p>
<p>
	Suppose you wish to find information about apples.  You might use a search like <em>apples -computers</em>. 
	You may get even more relevant results by using <em>apples +fruit</em>.
</p>


<div class="glossary_capital">U</div>

<div class="glossary_term" name="ultrapeer">Ultrapeer</div>

<p>
	An ultrapeer is well connected to the GnutellaNet.
	As ultrapeers must have many connections and route search queries,
	they require more resources than a <a href="#leaf">leaf</a> node. Ultrapeers will
	typically be connected to 30+ other ultrapeers and connected to 70+ leaf nodes.

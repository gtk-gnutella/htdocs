<h4>18 December 2015, Version 1.1.8 Released</h4>

<p>This is an emergency bug-fixing release.</p>

<p>It addresses systematic crashes on some platforms, right at startup time,
   and prevents random deadlocks on OS/X.</p>

<p>The systematic crash was due to an innocent change, which actually
   perturbed the order of the initialization routines and, depending on the
   conditions, caused an assertion failure during one of the thread startup.
   Curiously, the error manifests randomly and does not seem to depend on the OS
   but rather on other subtle environment issues: one Linux distribution could
   be fine whilst another was hit by the bug.</p>

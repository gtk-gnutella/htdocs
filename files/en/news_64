<h4>30 December 2011, Version 0.98.2 Released</h4>

<p>This is a minor patch to support systems running latest Ubuntu systems,
   and maybe others which create multiple threads for GTK programs: our
   <tt>xmalloc()</tt> implementation replaces the system's <tt>malloc()</tt> but
   it was not safe to use in multi-threaded environments.</p>

<h5>GUI improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>[GTK] Added option to discard results from banned GUIDs (set by
    default).</li>
<li>[GTK] Display results from servents with a banned GUID in "hot pink".</li>

</ul>
<h5>Other improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Updated turkish translation.</li>
<li>Added IPv6 geo-localization database (from Maxmind).</li>
<li>Added dynamic IPv6 hostile support.</li>

</ul>

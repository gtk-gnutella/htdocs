<h4>31 July 2005, Version 0.95.4 Released</h4>

<p>
  Version 0.95.4 is a bug fix release. Several bugs were
  fixed. We advise everyone to upgrade to this version of
  GTKG as it is the most stable version right now.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The last-byte download bug, where a download would not complete if
      only the last byte needed to be downloaded, has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Preliminary browse-host support, allowing other servents to browse
      the files that are shared. This is disabled by default.</li>
  <li>GTKG will detect online status again after temporary network
      failure.</li>
  <li>The .desktop file and application icons are now properly
      installed.</li>
  <li>Downloads are now sorting in a more logical way.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes in UTF-8 support.</li>
  <li>Doxygen documentation updates.</li>

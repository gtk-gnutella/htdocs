<h4>IRC Chat</h4>

<p>
  On the <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat network</a> we meet in the channel 
  <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/gtk-gnutella">#gtk-gnutella at irc.libera.chat</a>;
 a <a href="https://www.gtk-gnutella.nl/Irc/Log">chat log</a> is available.
  There's always someone there, but not always someone 
  who knows the answer to your question. You need an IRC client like 
  <a href="http://www.xchat.org">xchat</a> to visit the channel. Though, if you don't
  get any reaction in time, consider sending a mail to one of the mailing lists.

<h4>SourceForge</h4>

<p> 
  The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gtk-gnutella/bugs/">
  Bug Tracker</a> and 
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gtk-gnutella/feature-requests/">
  Feature Requests</a> are available on SourceForge, but you will most
  likely get a better response on the mailing lists or IRC. There is
  also a <a href="?page=bugreport_howto"> bug report howto</a>.

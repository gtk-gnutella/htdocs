<h3><a name="extended_guide">Extended guide</a></h3>
<p>With git you will always retreive a clone of a remote repository. This will
contain all the current source files including their full history. This means once
you have a cloned repository you can browse through all changesets without being
connected to the internet, if the remote would disapear you still have a full
copy available locally.</p>
<p>To retrieve this clone you need to git clone. To clone the gtk-gnutella 
repository you can use the following command:
<kbd>git clone https://github.com/gtk-gnutella/gtk-gnutella.git</kbd>. Which 
will output:
	<samp>$ git clone https://github.com/gtk-gnutella/gtk-gnutella.git
Cloning into gtk-gnutella...
remote: Counting objects: 111280, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (20316/20316), done.
remote: Total 111280 (delta 90978), reused 111082 (delta 90780)
Receiving objects: 100% (111280/111280), 47.27 MiB | 1.32 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (90978/90978), done.
</samp>
</p>

<p>Now that you have cloned the git repository lets enter the newly
created directory: <kbd>cd gtk-gnutella</kbd>. You are now in your freshly
created git clone of gtk-gnutella. We use 2 branches on our public repository, 
you can view them using the following command: <kbd>git branch -a</kbd>.
<samp>$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/devel
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/v0.93
</samp>
You will notice master, origin/master and origin/devel, we'll ignore the origin/v0.93 for now.
</p>
<p>
By default git automatically tracks the origin/master branch in our master branch,
to also track the origin/devel branch in a local branch so we can actually
use that branch we need to track it locally. To track origin/devel in a local 
devel branch enter the following command:
<kbd>git checkout -b devel origin/devel</kbd>
<samp>$ git checkout -b devel origin/devel
Branch devel set up to track remote branch devel from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'devel'
</samp>
Now if we do a <kbd>git branch -a</kbd> we'll see that there is a new devel
branch in the output
<samp>$ git branch -a
* devel
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/devel
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/v0.93
</samp>
Notice the * mark before the devel, this means this is the current active
branch we are working on. This was done by the command git checkout -b devel/origin/devel which
told us "Switched to a new branch 'devel'".

<p>
Although we are now tracking 2 remote branches, git branch -a didn't tell us 
what branch is tracking what. To view your local branches and tell what remote
branch it is tracking enter the command <kbd>git branch -vv</kbd>.
<samp>$ git branch -vv
* devel  ecd14a9 [origin/devel] Added IPv6-Ready implementation.
  master b401063 [origin/master] vxml_read_char(): removed check made too early.
</samp>
As you see, devel is tracking origin/devel and master is tracking origin/master.
Origin is set to our github.com/gtk-gnutella URL, you can view this with
<kbd>git remote -v</kbd>.
<samp>$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/gtk-gnutella/gtk-gnutella.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/gtk-gnutella/gtk-gnutella.git (push)
</samp>

<h3>Branches</h3> 
<p>
There are currently 2 branches on our public repository:
<ul>
<li>master, our stable branch only patches are applied to this branch and is always ready for a release;</li>
<li>devel, is where all new features are pushed to and might not be release ready.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Use the master branch if you are only interested in the latest fixes. You might
want to use this to build a new stable build with all the latest fixes applied.
Use the devel branch if you want to help us test our new features or if you can't 
wait for some of these features to appear in the stable master branch. We need
people to test new features and it would be great if you'd test the devel branch
and report any issues to us at the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gtk-gnutella/bugs/">bug tracker</a> 
or by mail at 
<a href="mailto:gtk-gnutella-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">gtk-gnutella-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

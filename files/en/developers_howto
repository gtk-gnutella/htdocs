<h2>Developers Howto</h2>
<p>
  What I'm going to tell you applies to really anyone who wishes to start
  working on GTKG:
  <ul>
    <li>Read the source code: take one functionality you'd like to understand,
    and follow the execution path.  Use the "tags" mode of your favorite
    editor to navigate, and tools like "cscope" to cross-reference things.</li>

    <li>Learn the doc/devguide/STYLE by heart, before making any change to the
    code.  It is important that we all use a uniform coding style to make
    the source pleasant to read.  The coding style we picked (mine, mostly)
    is not arbitrary: it is the one used most commonly in the industry.</li>

    <li>Learn basics of Glib: lists and hash tables.  They're used everywhere.
    You can also learn the I/O stuff, but it is less important to master
    at first.</li>

    <li>Last but not least, if you wish to work on the Gnutella core, you need
    to learn and understand the Gnutella protocol itself, but also master
    HTTP/1.1 specs.</li>

    <li>Start with small features / bug fixes.  The code is not that complex, but
    the data structures are, and their relationships are quite tricky.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We have quite big projects ahead of us:
  <ol>
    <li>Ultrapeer support (I've started working on that).</li>
    <li>PARQ: passive/active remote queueing.</li>
    <li>Tiger tree hash integration.</li>
    <li>Metadata collection for shared files (e.g. for audio, the type, length and
    the bitrate, for videos: the type of codec, length, resolution on screen.
    For images, type (jpg, gif) and size. etc...).</li>
    <li>Support for XML queries, so that people can search for various types of
    characteristics on the collected metadata.</li>
    <li>magnet: URI support: make GTKG a magnet: handler.</li>
    <li>Separation of the core process and the GUI processes.</li>
    <li>Redesign of the logging layer, to separate different logs of the
    various subsystems.  Present to the users only the warnings he can
    understand or do something about.</li>
    <li>Skim through all the recorded "feature request" on sourceforge to see
    whether we have forgotten something. ;-)</li>
    <li>Documentation.  We lack documentation.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  If you wish to participate to Gnutella core development, you also need
  to register to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/the_gdf/">
  GDF (Gnutella Developer Forum)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Also, get familiar with ALL the documentation available in the "Files" section
  of the GDF, and in the doc/ directory of the gtk-gnutella sources.  You don't
  need to do that in one weekend though ;-)  But at least browse it once.
</p>

<p>
  At first, changes you make should be sent via e-mail for integration.
  The preferred way to make those diffs is via "cvs diff -u".  After a few
  successful patches, when you get used to the code, you will be granted direct
  CVS access in write mode.
</p>

<p>
  You should be aware that our quality standards are quite high.  We do not
  usually commit something that does not work to CVS.  Here, "work" means
  that it has been tested reasonably for a few days, to make sure nothing is
  wrong.
</p>

<p>
  If after all this you're still willing to help, then I'm sure you have all
  it takes to be able to do wonders.  True wonders.  And of course you're most
  welcome in the "developer's team".
</p>

<p>
I should add that until now, I have enjoyed working with the other developers:
</p>

<p>
  Richard, of course, is a truly amazing contributor, who always surprises me with
  the quality of his implementation.  Richard has been promoted "co-admin" on
  the project recently (not that *I* care about those hierarchical distinctions,
  but they're always nice on a resume).
</p>

<p>
  Vidar, who contributed the swarming code.  It took me a whole month to be
  able to master it and make it evolve, so it says a lot about the complexity
  and the value of his contribution.  Truly impressive work.
</p>

<p>
  Christope Biere, who recently joined, has produced very useful patches.
  He may be able to comment further on what I said here, and tell you more
  about his experience, how he managed to learn from the source code, whatever.
</p>

<p>
  All developers join on the #gtk-gnutella of IRC (freenode.net), and, as a
  matter of fact, we're all Europeans in the same time zone!
</p>

<p>
  I'm looking forward to a bigger development team that will enable us to
  do more in less time, for the benefit of our end users!<br>

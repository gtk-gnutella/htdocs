<h3>The Graphical Gnutella Client for Unix</h3>

<p>
Gtk-Gnutella is a clone of Gnutella (see <A HREF="http://gnutella.wego.com/">gnutella.wego.com</A>).
It runs on every Unix which supports <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</A> (1.2 or above). 
Gnome is not needed but <a href="http://www.libxml.org">libxml</a> should be available for best
performance.
It is currently developed and tested under Linux (Debian 2.2) and is known to run at least on Linux and FreeBSD (on 80x86 machines). 
Rumor has it that some people even run it under XDarwin on MacOS.<br><br>
It is released under the GNU Public License (GPL).
</p>

<p>
Gtk-Gnutella is not finished yet, but it is fully functional: you may share, search, and download.
And it is stable too, users usually just leave it run unattended for days.
</p>

All ideas, comments, bug reports are welcome to <I>rmanfredi at users dot sourceforge dot net</I>, or to the gtk-gnutella-devel mailing list.

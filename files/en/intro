<h3>The Most Efficient Gnutella Client</h3>

<p>

  It runs on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and every Unix-like system which supports
<a href="https://www.gtk.org/" target="_blank">GTK+</a> (1.2 or above).
  The GNOME desktop environment is not required. It is currently developed
  and tested under Linux (<a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian</a>) as
  well as <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org" target="_blank">NetBSD</a>. It is known to run at
  least on Linux,
  <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/net-p2p/gtk-gnutella/" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a>,

  Public License (GPL-2).

<p>
  gtk-gnutella is not finished yet, but it is fully functional: you may share, 
  search, and download.  And it is stable too, users usually just leave it run 
  unattended for days.

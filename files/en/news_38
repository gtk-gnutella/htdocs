<h4>6. Febuary 2004, 0.93.x branched off</h4>
<p>
	Today Jeroen created the <code>B-0-93</code> branch in CVS. Only fixes are supposed
	to go there. We think that 0.93.3 is already pretty stable, but we want to
	improve stability even more with 0.93.4. The HEAD branch of CVS will become 0.94.
</p>
<p>
	To fetch the latest fixes for 0.93.3, you can check out the <code>B-0-93</code> branch
	using the following commands:<br>
  <br>
  <code>
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gtk-gnutella login<br>
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gtk-gnutella co -r B-0-93 gtk-gnutella-current
  </code><br>
	<br>
  When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

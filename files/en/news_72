<h4>8 April 2015, Version 1.1.3 Released</h4>

<p>This is mainly a critical bug-fixing release, addressing a huge
   shortcoming in 1.1.2: all Shareaza leaves are incorrectly flagged as being
   fakes and are being removed quicktly from ultrapeers, creating network churn
   and instability. Everyone running gtk-gnutella as Ultrapeer must upgrade to
   1.1.3 quickly.</p>

<p>Releasing quickly after 1.1.3 is also a pretext for improving stability on
   Windows platforms, especially after restarts: because Windows does not
   support the "close on exec" flag on file descriptors, restarted processes
   were left with several instances of a listening socket bound to the same
   port, causing havoc as behaviour is totally undefined and was most probably
   leading to the inability for the process to get any incoming
   connections.</p>

<p>On Windows, we now also monitor the memory usage more closely, in order to
   avoid the C runtime from issuing a (blocking) popup signalling a fatal memory
   allocation error should it run out of space.</p>

<p>More generally, the VMM layer is now capable of trapping fatal memory
   allocation errors and handling them more efficiently. In particular, when
   everything has failed, the layer can request a brutal restart of the process.
   Under less dire circumstances, a graceful restart will be requested.</p>

<p>This was also an occasion to revisit the long-term allocation strategy in
   the VMM layer and optimize it in order to further limit fragmentation of the
   VM space. Even though avoiding fragmentation matters mostly for 32-bit
   applications, this also limits the amount of individual memory region
   mappings the kernel has to maintain and gtk-gnutella has to keep track
   of.</p>

<p>Finally, a last-minute bug fix where a user reported a deadlock in the QRP
   processing code. After investigation, it turned out that there was indeed a
   recursive locking on a spinlock that had escaped all real-life testing out
   there so far!</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>[GTK2] Added popup menu icon in front of "force push mode" for
    sources.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Added warning icon in status bar when kernel runs short of net
    buffers.</li>
<li>Increased default node connection timeout and size of the quick connect
    pool.</li>
<li>Updated the shell "status" command to display "!IP" on net buffer
    shortage.</li>
<li>Updated FAQ along with French and Turkish translations.</li>
<li>Updated GeoIP databases.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fixed invalid test for "fake" Shareaza that led to network
    instabilities.</li>
<li>Made QRP lock a mutex to allow for recursive locking through
    <tt>qrp_comp_done()</tt>.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>On out-of-memory conditions, attempt to auto-restart if possible.</li>
<li>Windows: monitor committed memory, crashing before the kernel would kill
    us.</li>
<li>Added <tt>crash_restart()</tt> and controlling routines to request smooth
    restart.</li>
<li>On network buffer shortage (ENOBUFS), stop TCP connections for a
    while.</li>
<li>UPnP: protect upnp_mapping objects given to callbacks with reference
    counts.</li>
<li>Adjusted lock tracking when locks are disabled, fixing lock swapping.</li>
<li>Windows: remember socket descriptors so that we can close them on
    <tt>exec()</tt>.</li>
<li>Refactored code for listening sockets to warn when bound port is already
    used.</li>
<li>When shutdowning in "crash mode", skip most of the memory cleanup.</li>
<li><tt>rwlock_destroy()</tt>: make sure to write-unlock the lock if it was
    owned.</li>
<li><tt>waiter_ack()</tt>: don't panic if waiter was not notified, but loudly
    complain.</li>
<li><tt>upnp_map_natpmp_publish_reply()</tt>: trace given port on NAT-PMP
    mapping errors.</li>
<li><tt>upnp_discover()</tt>: force selection of IPv4 interface for UPnP
    discovery.</li>
<li><tt>thread_unsuspend_others()</tt>: relaxed hard assertion into a soft
    one.</li>
<li><tt>alloc_pages()</tt>: try harder on OOM conditions to allocate from the
    page cache.</li>
<li><tt>socket_connect_finalize()</tt>: fixed wrong errno processing for
    <tt>connect()</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>socket_connect_prepare()</tt>: no need for SO_REUSEADDR for
    connecting sockets.</li>

</ul>

<h4>9 November 2006, Version 0.96.3 Released</h4>

<p>
  Version 0.96.3 is a <b>stable</b> release. Fixing some
  bugs and adding a few improvements.
</p>
<p>
Below is the ChangeLog entry for the release.
</p>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  Portability fixes which affect the ARM architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
  Ultrapeers could be unnecessarily demoted to leaves in auto mode.
  </li>
  <li>
  [GTK2] Fixed a bug that could cause spurious assertion failures or memory    
   corruption.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed bug that might have caused truncation of printed numbers in certain
  places.
  </li>
  <li>
  Rewrite the upload_history file if the history was cleared.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed crash caused by an assertion failure that could occur if IPv6
  support was disabled at compile-time.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed buggy utf8_is_valid_data().
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a couple of small technical mistakes in translations.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed compilation for Cygwin without IPv6 support.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Updates</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  Updated French translation.
  </li>
  <li>
  Updated list of hostile IP ranges.
  </li>
  <li>
  Updated list of bootstrap caches.
  </li>
  <li>
  Updated list of country names and codes for Serbia and Montenegro.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  Turkish translation.
  </li>
  <li>
  New shell commands: online, offline, props, status.
  </li>
  <li>
  The search list allows selection of multiple items and applying actions to
  them now.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added a tray icon to hide the gtk-gnutella application windows. This
  feature requires Gtk+ 2.10 or newer.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added a limit of downloads per file which defaults to 40 to prevent using
  an unreasonably large amount of sources.
  </li>
  <li>
  Keep certain irrelevant columns empty for "local:" searches instead of
  showing bogus data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added README.Debian with instructions how to compile gtk-gnutella yourself
  on Debian-derived systems.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Under the hood</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  Rewrote "fast" assertions so that they are sufficiently portable and do
  not mess with debugging. Thus they are always enabled now which reduces
  code size signifcantly.
  </li>
  <li>
  The TLS cache is now persistent without SQLite too.
  </li>
  <li>
  Disabled reservation of Gnutella slots and vendor limits because it's not
  useful with the current population of Gnutella.
  </li>
  <li>
  Disabled GWebCache updates.
  </li>
  <li>
  Configure bails out now if a mandatory dependency e.g., libxml2, GLib,
  zlib isn't available.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added -Wshadow to the default compile flags for GCC for even cleaner code.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Checksums of the source tarball:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><tt>SHA256 (gtk-gnutella-0.96.3.tar.bz2) = 6079661ffeb78ae480cf37cf9954d0c437d415363aa4133268b732700b52be80</tt></li>

<h4>31 December 2013, Version 1.0.1 Released</h4>

<p>This is a minor release correcting a grave bug causing gtk-gnutella to
   think all other gtk-gnutella out there are hostile.</p>

<p>Other minor improvements are present, as well as low-level bug fixes. The
   most visible change is that filenames with parentheses are now mangled to
   have the parentheses turned into brackets, instead of being left as-is. This
   allows filename cut-n-paste into shell commands, without having to use the
   shell auto-completion to escape the parentheses.</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Generate a NM/1.0 HTTP-like header at the top of the pre-computed nm
    list.</li>
<li>[GTK] Avoid GUI flickering when widget sensitivity is changing
    quickly.</li>
<li>Replace "()" with "[]" in filenames for easier cut-n-paste in shell
    commands.</li>
<li>Windows: improved stack unwinding.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fixed grave bug, making all GTKGs appear hostile.</li>
<li><tt>qrp_close()</tt>: must disable periodic monitoring during
    shutdown.</li>
<li><tt>filename_to_utf8_normalized()</tt>: fixed broken if/else logic in

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>Updated the GeoIP databases.</li>
<li>Added a Keywords entry for lintian in the gtk-gnutella.desktop file.</li>
<li>Fixed license link to point to GPL-2 on Debian systems.</li>
<li>Added gtk-gnutella.appdata.xml for distributions that need such a
    file.</li>
<li>Renamed icon.xpm as icon.48x48.xpm and icon.32x32.xpm as icon.xpm.</li>
<li>TLS: disabled SVN signature verification code, since we no longer use
    SVN.</li>
<li>Define our own G_STRFUNC, do not use the version from GLib.</li>
<li><tt>vmm_resize()</tt>: fixed wrong implementation when vmm_crashing is
    true.</li>
<li>Semi-reliable UDP: drop traffic to host temporarily if we can't send
    messages.</li>
<li>Use a 5-minute TLS ban to avoid reconnecting to host with TLS when it
    failed.</li>
<li><tt>download_mark_active()</tt>: do not reset fi-&gt;recv_last_rate on
    HTTP follow-ups</li>
<li><tt>bsched_heartbeat()</tt>: fixed wrong delay computatation, use
    <tt>tm_elapsed_ms()</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>gtk_gnutella_exit()</tt>: always emit final "cleanly exited"
    info.</li>
<li><tt>zalloc_stack_accounting_ctrl()</tt>: used wrong lookup key, leading
    to crashes.</li>
<li><tt>mingw_valloc()</tt>: handle initial non-hinted allocations larger
    than page.</li>
<li><tt>signal_trap_with()</tt>: fixed improper return value computation for
    <tt>sigaction()</tt>.</li>

</ul>

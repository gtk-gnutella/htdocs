<h4>11 September 2011, Version 0.97.1 Released</h4>

<p>
Version 0.97.1 is a bug-fixing release, addressing critical bugs that slipped
through in the 0.97 release but which happen only in particular conditions.
</p>

<p>
The project also switched from SVN to git.  This affects the version number
which no longer includes a single SVN revision but instead uses the combination
of a counter for the number of changes since the last release plus git's
abbreviated commit ID. Tagged releases do not contain any build information.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bootstrapping problems on IPv6 enabled hosts [bug #3376322].</li>
<li>Forgot to clear global HTTP handle on GHC errors [bug #376322].</li>
<li>Typo caused crash when processing alternate locations in firewalled mode
    with PFSP enabled.</li>
<li>Forgot to clear pending THEX downloads on download stops.</li>
<li>Make sure we remove the SHA1 of de-indexed files from the shared set.</li>
<li>Handle "message too large" errors when sending on UDP.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Under the Hood</h5>

<ul>
<li>When running as ultra node, use GUESS introduction pings when requesting
    a query key so that the remote ultrapeer can passively discover us.</li>
<li>
Do not count GUID collisions with our own GUID when we see our own IP:port!
</li>
<li>
Added some gcc 4.6 <i>hot</i> / <i>cold</i> routine tagging for better
optimizations.
</li>
<li>
<code>netmask_to_cidr()</code>: was not using the proper metaconfig symbol to
activate the usage of <code>__builtin_popcount</code>.
</li>
<li>
Updated <code>build.sh</code> to build an app bundle for OSX with target=osxbundle.
</li>
<li>
Added <i>dmg</i> to the default extension list for shared files.
</li>
<li>
Added OS X integration support: menu bar is now on the OS menubar on top,
the application does a clean exit on cmd-q and the application continues
to run when only the window is closed.
</li>
<li>
Use the downloads folder on Windows 7 and Vista for completed downloads.
</li>
<li>
Updated the geographic IP mapping database.
</li>
<li>

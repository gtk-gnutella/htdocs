<h4>3. Mar 2003, Version 0.92 beta2 released</h4>
<p>
This is a bugfix release. If you used beta1, please update to this beta. Also
note that precompiled versions only exist for GTK1 as GTK2 is too slow for most
users right now.
</p>
<ul> 
<li> Fixed Gnutella web cache hammering.  A buggy test caused GTKG to query
  the caches each time it was establishing an outgoing connection!
<li> Domain name resolution for Gnutella web cache are now done asynchronously.
  The GUI will no longer freeze due to a DNS request.
<li> Some performance improvements: removed the most important bottlenecks.
<li> Fixed flow-control bug, exercised mainly with compressed connections: they
  could stall abruptly, no longer transmitting data.
<li> Fixed assertion failure in PARQ client code.
<li> Fixed incomplete clearing of downloads from a given host.
<li> <b>Warning:</b> The amount of bandwidth configured for leaves is currently automatically
  added to the HTTP connections when not in leaf mode, regardless of whether
  "use surplus bandwidth" is activated.  This will change in the release.
</ul>

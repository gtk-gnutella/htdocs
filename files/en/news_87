<h4>25 February 2022, Version 1.2.2 Released</h4>

<p>This is a maintenance release with major bug fixes.</p>

<p>There were several shortcomings with bandwidth management: capping was not
   performed correctly and could overuse uploading bandwidth. Also when the DHT
   is turned off or on, we need to recompute proper bandwidth stealing.</p>

<p>Corruption of the DHT disk databases could also lead to a crash.</p>

<p>There was a critical old bug in the Dynamic Querying layer that affected
   Ultrapeers mostly: we could corrupt memory and/or crash when the current node
   was removed and we were processing a Dynamic Query for that node. This is
   more likely to happen when running as an Ultrapeer but it could also affect
   nodes running as leaves, although the probability of that bug happening is
   much less in that case.</p>

<p>Finally, it is best to not iterate on a global list that could get changed
   due to a node removal. This was the case when sending pongs to neighbouring
   nodes, so we now take a private copy.</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Extended "props" shell command with -e (exact) and -i (ignore
    missing).</li>
<li>The "props" command now takes a set of properties, handled as one
    batch.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Properly recompute bandwidth stealing on DHT changes.</li>
<li>Avoid crashing in D-Bus lib when filename is improperly UTF-8
    encoded.</li>
<li>DHT: protect against corrupted database.</li>
<li><code>bw_available()</code>: fix invalid logic for I/O source
    capping.</li>
<li><code>pong_all_neighbours_but_one()</code>: iterate on local list.</li>
<li><code>dq_node_removed()</code>: must free dq object asynchronously.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>Update IRC network information: moved from freenode to libera.chat</li>
<li>Chunk size limiting for uploads accounts for bandwidth.</li>
<li>Reduce memory footprint for statx_t if no data kept.</li>
<li>CQ: defer freeing of dispatched event.</li>
<li>watchdog: be more verbose within critical messages.</li>
<li><code>node_parse()</code>: signal to callers when we have BYE-ed the
    node.</li>
<li><code>cq_event_called()</code>: use better diagnostic on assert
    failure.</li>
<li><code>dbus_util_send_message()</code>: protect against invalid text.</li>
<li><code>prepare_entry()</code>: ensure entry invariant remains true.</li>
<li><code>wd_expire()</code>: do nothing if watchdog was asleep.</li>

</ul>

<h4>7. January 2004, New GTK-GNUTELLA Logo?</h4>
<p>
  Think the banner logo at the top of this page is ugly?  Maybe you can do 
  better!  Send your images (or preferably a link to them) to the 
  <a href="http://gtk-gnutella.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=mailing"> 
    -devel or -users mail list.</a>  If your logo is chosen you will win... um, 
  well, let's see - a place among the Hall of Fame of gtk-gnutella contributors 
  and a special notice on the webpage.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update 14.1.2004:</strong>
	Images will be accepted until the 31th January 2004.

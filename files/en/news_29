<h4>15. August 2003, Version 0.92.1 released</h4>
<p>
  You can get this new version from our download section.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>These are some of the changes made since 0.92 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for push proxies was added which reduces problems with firewalled 
    servents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for pre-0.90 configuration files has been dropped.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved PARQ and fixed some problems with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default directories for downloads are now set to $HOME.
  </li>
  <li>  
    A lot of minor bugfixes and code clean-ups so that it compiles on even 
    more platforms and with other (C99) compilers.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTKG can now monitor unstable IP addresses and unstable servents, to avoid 
    keeping connecting to bad nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The download pane now shows how many items are actively and passively 
    queued.
  </li>
  <li>
    The search pane allows one to hide hits that are either ignored or which 
    have been already queued up by the core due to a matching SHA1 or filename.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button could be hidden due to long filenames (#770625).
  </li>
  <li>  
    A duplicate free() problem was fixed in _search_send_packet() (#706014).
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button no longer cause crashes (#757276).
  </li>
  <li>
    A bug which could cause a crash when resuming a download was fixed 
    (#739262).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect only the GTK+ 2.x front-end:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    XFT support is not turned off by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    The node and the uploads panel have been tuned (a little).
  </li>
  <li>
    No more crashes if the uploads are sorted by status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-UTF-8 encoded were passed to GTK+ 2.x causing warnings (#769342)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect the build system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Switched to metaconfig, and abandoned autoconf/automake.  There may be 
    some portability issues introduced on non-linux system since there are 
    lots of new metaconfig units that had to be developed for the 
    configuration of GTKG.  In the long run, it will catch up.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "intl" directory containing GNU gettext() is no longer supported, 
    because it is currently only configurable via autoconf.  If you don't have 
    proper GNU gettext() support on your system, you might have to disable NLS 
    support to be able to compile.
  </li>
</ul>

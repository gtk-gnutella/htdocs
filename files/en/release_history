<h4><a name="0.93.3"></a>25. January 2004, Version 0.93.3 released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.93.2 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GUI updates:
    <ul>
      <li>
        New node info display configuration: show library size / number of 
        files shared, configurable from the Config / User interface pane.
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of file descriptors currently used for banning is now shown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increased search results sorting speed for GTK1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moved "close" button for searches to a more convenient position, in 
        the upper right corner.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Default number of node connections raised to 12 now that many servents 
    support high outdegree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eradication of memory leaks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhanced flow-control algorithm that will more aggressively drop packets 
    (including query hits) when the connection remains clogged for too long.

<h4><a name="0.93.2"></a>5. January 2004, Version 0.93.2 released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.93.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Numerous GUI updates:
    <ul>
      <li>
        GTK1 now supports grouped searches and grouped downloads, like GTK2
        did.
      </li>
      <li>
        GTK1 and GTK2 GUIs were brought in sync feature-wise, as much as 
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gnet pane will now show leaf nodes and normal nodes in light gray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed memory leak problems in the GTK2 interface that slipped into 
        0.93.1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth requirements to become an ultranode were lowered significantly.
    This is due to the filtering of SHA1 queries through QRP now, instead of
    systematically forwarding them: gtk-gnutella assumes all servents out 
    there include the SHA1 URNs in their QRP tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a result of the above, default amount of leaf nodes was increased. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a special fix for BearShare: the HTTP headers which gtk-gnutella
    emitted used continuations, and were well-formed, but BearShare was
    misparsing those, causing it to enter an endless loop...
  </li>
  <li>
    Search results are now buffered by the GUI for burst updates, which
    reduces CPU usage and the amount of redrawing significantly.  The 
    buffering time is configurable from the GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gtk-gnutella is now fully compliant with LimeWire regarding I18N queries, 
    provided you have the ICU library.  Otherwise, it should be OK for roman
    charsets only.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.93.1">28. December 2003, Version 0.93.1 released</a></h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.93 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Simplified the GUI for non-experts.  Beginners will now see less curious
    things on the screen, until they become more acquainted and turn on
    "expert" mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many improvements in the GUI:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Gnutella node information displayed can now be configured in
        detail, and is by default reduced to four statistics only.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible to hide the handshaking version and the Uptime column
        from the Gnutella pane.
      </li>
      <li>
        When running in auto mode, show the criteria for becoming an ultranode.
      </li>
      <li>
        The leaf node bandwidth odometers are by default automatically hidden
        when running as a leaf node.
      </li>
      <li>
        GUI refreshing has been optimized so we don't unnecessarily refresh
        screens that the user is not looking at.  The downside is that when
        moving to that screen, stale data is presented for about 1 second
        until the refreshing takes place.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    0.93 was not reporting uploaded partial files as such to downloading peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control "shell" is now compiled in by default but needs to be
    explicitly enabled in the GUI to become operational.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved connectivity between ultrapeers to avoid frequent disconnection 
    due to "activity timeout".
  </li>
  <li>
    Bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Was misparsing query hits bearing alt-locs attached to each hit,
        causing GTKG to possibly drop those hits and close the connection when
        coming from an immediate neighbour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When restarting a search from menu, re-enable it automatically if it
        was disabled (fixes bug <?php sf_bug("864348");?>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon restart, a disabled search will now be shown in gray in the
        search list (fixes bug <?php sf_bug("857972");?>) -- feature only implemented for GTK1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Many other little changes that we'll let you discover...
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.93"></a>2. November 2003, Version 0.93 released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.92.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GTK-Gnutella now supports Partial File serving, both as a client and as a
    server. As soon as a download is started, it can be used as an alternate
    source for others even though the download is not completed yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a mismatch happens during downloading, the file can now be
    automatically removed and restarted again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved GUI to specify better which downloads should be cleared from the
    list (completed, failed, unavailable).
  </li>
  <li>
    Collects alternate download locations acquired from query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for hostname instead of only an ip. If you have a dynamic ip but
    got a static hostname, for example a .dyndns.org address, gtk-gnutella can
    try to connect to the ip associated with the hostname.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sends out alternate locations which should not be tried.
  </li>
  <li>
    Won't send full headers when short on bandwith.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any changes in settings are now automatically saved, there is no need to
    quit the client anymore to make sure the settings are saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Running gtk-gnutella in Auto peermode should no longer cause a crash.
  </li>
  <li>
    New addresses in hostiles.txt to protect against malicious hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
    gwcache.boot was cleaned up. Dead links were removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control should actually work without crashing gtk-gnutella.
  </li>
  <li>
    The build problems which occured in 0.92.1 due to the switch to metaconfig
    should be (mostly) gone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Code cleanup to build on more platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTK2 interface currently does not have a maintainer, not all options which
    are available in the GTK1 interface might have made it in the GTK2
    interface.
  </li>

<h4><a name="0.92.1"></a>15. August 2003, Version 0.92.1 released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.92 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for push proxies was added which reduces problems with firewalled
    servents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for pre-0.90 configuration files has been dropped.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved PARQ and fixed some problems with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default directories for downloads are now set to $HOME.
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of minor bugfixes and code clean-ups so that it compiles on even
    more platforms and with other (C99) compilers.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTKG can now monitor unstable IP addresses and unstable servents, to avoid
    keeping connecting to bad nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The download pane now shows how many items are actively and passively
    queued.
  </li>
  <li>
    The search pane allows one to hide hits that are either ignored or which
    have been already queued up by the core due to a matching SHA1 or filename.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button could be hidden due to long filenames (<?php sf_bug("770625");?>).
  </li>
  <li>
    A duplicate free() problem was fixed in _search_send_packet() (<?php sf_bug("706014");?>).
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button no longer cause crashes (<?php sf_bug("757276");?>).
  </li>
  <li>
    A bug which could cause a crash when resuming a download was fixed
    (<?php sf_bug("739262");?>).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect only the GTK+ 2.x front-end:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    XFT support is not turned off by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    The node and the uploads panel have been tuned (a little).
  </li>
  <li>
    No more crashes if the uploads are sorted by status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-UTF-8 encoded were passed to GTK+ 2.x causing warnings (<?php sf_bug("769342");?>)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect the build system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Switched to metaconfig, and abandoned autoconf/automake.  There may be
    some portability issues introduced on non-linux system since there are 
    lots of new metaconfig units that had to be developed for the 
    configuration of GTKG.  In the long run, it will catch up.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "intl" directory containing GNU gettext() is no longer supported,
    because it is currently only configurable via autoconf.  If you don't have
    proper GNU gettext() support on your system, you might have to disable NLS
    support to be able to compile.
  </li>
</ul>



<h4><a name="0.92"></a>15. June 2003, Version 0.92 released</h4>
<p>
  Here are some of the changes since 0.91.1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now supports Ultrapeers, which means GTKG can work as an ultra node or as
    a leaf node.  You can still run as a normal node, although this is not
    something wise to do, because that will likely relegate you to a small
    part of the Gnutella network.
  </li>
  <li>
    New icons for showing node state (leaf or ultra mode).
  </li>
  <li>
    The GTK2 front-end is no longer experimental, albeit it is slower than
    the GTK1.2 front-end.  This is due to the somewhat inefficient
    implementation of the underlying GTK library.  Don't use GTK2 unless you
    have the equivalent of a 1 GHz Intel chip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added client-side PFSP support (partial file sharing). GTKG can download
    from servers holding partial files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added full PARQ support (Passive / Active Remote Queuing), both for
    upload and downloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    New Gnet statistics: flow-controlled packets per TTL and hops.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Type" column in the Gnet connection pane was turned into "Flags".
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for GGEP in pings/pongs/pushes: those packets are now
    accepted and forwarded to connections advertising GGEP support.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "use surplus bandwidth" setting: all unused bandwidth for Gnet or
    HTTP can be stolen by the other in case it needs some.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added count for total bytes uploaded and downloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for vendor-specific messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    New hops-flow support: remote flow-controlled connections can now warn
    us that they are flow-controlling us, and so we can drop queries
    immediately instead of sending them, saving outgoing bandwidth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now show the GTKG version in query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    The queue now shows the count of alive downloads, as well as the queue
    count.  An "alive" download is an entry for which the remote server
    replies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed the connection algorithm: will now attempt to connect to more
    nodes than really configured, dropping the surplus connections later,
    when needed at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    Filters out hostile IP addresses.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "Fileinfo" pane in the download screen.  Not finished, but will show
    the currently registered downloads and their status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Domain name resolution for Gnutella web cache are now done
    asynchronously.  The GUI will no longer freeze due to a DNS request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some performance improvements: removed the most important bottlenecks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.91.1"></a>22. Nov 2002, Version 0.91.1 stable released</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Here are some of the changes since 0.91:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Will now verify the SHA1 of downloaded files in the background.
  </li>
  <li>
    New configuration parameter for the directory where "bad files" not 
    matching their advertised SHA1 should be put (don't forget to configure 
    it, as it defaults to /tmp).
  </li>
  <li>
    Files are now copied in the background, so it is possible to setup the 
    various "download" directories on different filesystems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Node connection time and remote node's uptime (if available) are now shown.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is now possible to paste a "magnet:" URI in the search to launch a SHA1 
    search.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "connection indicator" at the bottom left is now a toggle.  Depressing 
    it will terminate any Gnet connection but will continue to serve uploads 
    and process downloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    The active download status now shows how many sources are available and 
    how many are currently active (i.e. downloading).  It will also show the 
    estimated remaining time for the whole file, as well as the global 
    reception rate for the file, accounting for all currently active sources.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed bug that prevented proper downloading from recent BearShare (4.1.x 
    or better) and Shareaza (1.6.0.x or better) nodes when the SHA1 of the 
    file is known.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now protect against "PUSH floods" by banning the relevant IPs.
  </li>
  <li>
    At startup, scan the download "tmp" dir for orphan files and reintegrate 
    them into the fileinfo database, moving completed files to the relevant  
    directory (depending on whether its SHA1 checked OK).
  </li>
  <li>
    Minor bug fixing: improper countdown for push timeout when falling back, 
    fixed corner-case processing that could lead to crashes or incorrect 
    behaviour, accidental localization on X-Live-Since headers, freezing of 
    the GUI when clearing many uploads, obscure portability fixes.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.91"></a>19. Oct 2002, Version 0.91 stable released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Here are some of the changes since 0.90:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now uses HTTP/1.1, which implies support for persistent connections. 
  </li>
  <li>
    gtk-gnutella will now monitor whether we're connected to Internet and 
    slow down its connection requests when it detects the connection was 
    broken (after a delay of ~3 minutes at most).
  </li>
  <li>
    Download swarming is now supported: gtk-gnutella will download different 
    portions of the same file from many hosts, as long as alternate sources 
    are available.
  </li>
  <li>
    The download mesh (alternate source collection during downloads) is now 
    used to fill the download queue with more sources.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternate locations can also be passively collected from query hits. You 
    can enable this in the swarming section on the download config pane.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download scheduling was entirely redesigned to avoid hammering busy hosts 
    and scale to 5000+ entries in the queue without slowing down the whole.
  </li>
  <li>
    Is now smart about the "push" flag and will try to ignore it if possible, 
    in case the remote host wrongly set the flag but is not firewalled.
  </li>
  <li>
    gtk-gnutella now remembers the files it downloaded and will ignore further 
    requests to download the same file.  It will visually mark those files, as 
    well as the ones it already shares, by showing them in lighter color in 
    the search results.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is possible to supply to gtk-gnutella your own ignore lists by SHA1 and 
    by name/size but the feature is under-documented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an "expert mode".  Only when this is enabled will gtk-gnutella show 
    the users some of the most complex settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    New Gnutella statistics pane, showing the packets we sent and received, 
    how many we generated, and the reasons why we drop packets, by packet type.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now understands UTF-8 queries, but does not generate them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed important bugs whereby all earlier versions of gtk-gnutella were 
    unintentionally corrupting the Gnutella traffic!
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved away from the public hostcaches and now uses the Gnutella Web Cache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now show all upload attempts, not only the ones that are 
    transferring. If the connection is aborted, the reason is also shown.
  </li>
  <li>
    New search stats types: queries by router, whole query.
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Queries by router" shows how many queries have been recieved from any 
        node gtk-gnutella was directly connected to.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Whole query" shows stats based on the complete query string instead 
        of individual query words.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    New visual indications via icons in the status bar: whether gtk-gnutella 
    is rebuilding the library, computing SHA1 of shared files in the 
    background, and whether we are connected to Internet or not.
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    Added Gnutella bandwidth management (0.85 already had HTTP bandwidth

  </li>
  <li>
    Searches can now be listed on the left side of the screen, or as tabs 
    like in the previous versions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added automatic banning of servents that are hammering us.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many more cool new features that you'll discover whilst playing with it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.85"></a>04. April 2002, Version 0.85 stable released</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Summary of changes (user-visible) since 0.80:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now support Gnutella traffic prioritization and flow-control for enhanced 
    stability of connections.
  </li>
  <li>
    Can now use an HTTP proxy for outgoing connections, in addition to SOCKS 
    v4 and v5 proxies.
  </li>
  <li>
    When "Force local IP" is ticked, gtk-gnutella will try to automatically 
    update the value if it detects a change in your IP address.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added search statistics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added persistent upload statistics, keeping track of which files were 
    uploaded by users, and how many times.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now show the size of the uploaded file and the requested range, under 
    the form "request @ offset" in the Range column.
  </li>
  <li>
    Node servent names are now displayed in the gnutellaNet window, if known.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth management for input and output traffic is now possible.  It can 
    only be configured via the config file though, not via the GUI.  It only 
    accounts upload/download traffic, not Gnet traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Displayed transfer rates are now instantaneous transfer rates, not average.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon completion, uploads and downloads show the time spent in transfer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hidden useless gnutellaNet stats window.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.93.2"></a>5. January 2004, Version 0.93.2 released</a></h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.93.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Numerous GUI updates:
    <ul>
      <li>
        GTK1 now supports grouped searches and grouped downloads, like GTK2
        did.
      </li>
      <li>
        GTK1 and GTK2 GUIs were brought in sync feature-wise, as much as 
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gnet pane will now show leaf nodes and normal nodes in light gray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed memory leak problems in the GTK2 interface that slipped into 
        0.93.1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth requirements to become an ultranode were lowered significantly.
    This is due to the filtering of SHA1 queries through QRP now, instead of
    systematically forwarding them: gtk-gnutella assumes all servents out 
    there include the SHA1 URNs in their QRP tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a result of the above, default amount of leaf nodes was increased. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a special fix for BearShare: the HTTP headers which gtk-gnutella
    emitted used continuations, and were well-formed, but BearShare was
    misparsing those, causing it to enter an endless loop...
  </li>
  <li>
    Search results are now buffered by the GUI for burst updates, which
    reduces CPU usage and the amount of redrawing significantly.  The 
    buffering time is configurable from the GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gtk-gnutella is now fully compliant with LimeWire regarding I18N queries, 
    provided you have the ICU library.  Otherwise, it should be OK for roman
    charsets only.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.93.1">28. December 2003, Version 0.93.1 released</a></h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.93 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Simplified the GUI for non-experts.  Beginners will now see less curious
    things on the screen, until they become more acquainted and turn on
    "expert" mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many improvements in the GUI:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Gnutella node information displayed can now be configured in
        detail, and is by default reduced to four statistics only.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible to hide the handshaking version and the Uptime column
        from the Gnutella pane.
      </li>
      <li>
        When running in auto mode, show the criteria for becoming an ultranode.
      </li>
      <li>
        The leaf node bandwidth odometers are by default automatically hidden
        when running as a leaf node.
      </li>
      <li>
        GUI refreshing has been optimized so we don't unnecessarily refresh
        screens that the user is not looking at.  The downside is that when
        moving to that screen, stale data is presented for about 1 second
        until the refreshing takes place.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    0.93 was not reporting uploaded partial files as such to downloading peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control "shell" is now compiled in by default but needs to be
    explicitly enabled in the GUI to become operational.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved connectivity between ultrapeers to avoid frequent disconnection 
    due to "activity timeout".
  </li>
  <li>
    Bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Was misparsing query hits bearing alt-locs attached to each hit,
        causing GTKG to possibly drop those hits and close the connection when
        coming from an immediate neighbour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When restarting a search from menu, re-enable it automatically if it
        was disabled (fixes bug #864348).
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon restart, a disabled search will now be shown in gray in the
        search list (fixes bug #857972) -- feature only implemented for GTK1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Many other little changes that we'll let you discover...
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="0.93"></a>2. November 2003, Version 0.93 released</a></h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.92.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GTK-Gnutella now supports Partial File serving, both as a client and as a
    server. As soon as a download is started, it can be used as an alternate
    source for others even though the download is not completed yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a mismatch happens during downloading, the file can now be
    automatically removed and restarted again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved GUI to specify better which downloads should be cleared from the
    list (completed, failed, unavailable).
  </li>
  <li>
    Collects alternate download locations acquired from query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for hostname instead of only an ip. If you have a dynamic ip but
    got a static hostname, for example a .dyndns.org address, gtk-gnutella can
    try to connect to the ip associated with the hostname.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sends out alternate locations which should not be tried.
  </li>
  <li>
    Won't send full headers when short on bandwith.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any changes in settings are now automatically saved, there is no need to
    quit the client anymore to make sure the settings are saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Running gtk-gnutella in Auto peermode should no longer cause a crash.
  </li>
  <li>
    New addresses in hostiles.txt to protect against malicious hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
    gwcache.boot was cleaned up. Dead links were removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control should actually work without crashing gtk-gnutella.
  </li>
  <li>
    The build problems which occured in 0.92.1 due to the switch to metaconfig
    should be (mostly) gone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Code cleanup to build on more platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTK2 interface currently does not have a maintainer, not all options which
    are available in the GTK1 interface might have made it in the GTK2
    interface.
  </li>

<h4><a name="0.92.1"></a>15. August 2003, Version 0.92.1 released</a></h4>
<p>
  <strong>These are changes made since 0.92 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for push proxies was added which reduces problems with firewalled
    servents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for pre-0.90 configuration files has been dropped.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved PARQ and fixed some problems with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default directories for downloads are now set to $HOME.
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of minor bugfixes and code clean-ups so that it compiles on even
    more platforms and with other (C99) compilers.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTKG can now monitor unstable IP addresses and unstable servents, to avoid
    keeping connecting to bad nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The download pane now shows how many items are actively and passively
    queued.
  </li>
  <li>
    The search pane allows one to hide hits that are either ignored or which
    have been already queued up by the core due to a matching SHA1 or filename.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button could be hidden due to long filenames (#770625).
  </li>
  <li>
    A duplicate free() problem was fixed in _search_send_packet() (#706014).
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Purge" button no longer cause crashes (#757276).
  </li>
  <li>
    A bug which could cause a crash when resuming a download was fixed
    (#739262).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect only the GTK+ 2.x front-end:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    XFT support is not turned off by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    The node and the uploads panel have been tuned (a little).
  </li>
  <li>
    No more crashes if the uploads are sorted by status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-UTF-8 encoded were passed to GTK+ 2.x causing warnings (#769342)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following changes affect the build system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Switched to metaconfig, and abandoned autoconf/automake.  There may be
    some portability issues introduced on non-linux system since there are 
    lots of new metaconfig units that had to be developed for the 
    configuration of GTKG.  In the long run, it will catch up.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "intl" directory containing GNU gettext() is no longer supported,
    because it is currently only configurable via autoconf.  If you don't have
    proper GNU gettext() support on your system, you might have to disable NLS
    support to be able to compile.
  </li>
</ul>



<h4><a name="0.92"></a>15. June 2003, Version 0.92 released</a></h4>
<p>
  Here are some of the changes since 0.91.1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now supports Ultrapeers, which means GTKG can work as an ultra node or as
    a leaf node.  You can still run as a normal node, although this is not
    something wise to do, because that will likely relegate you to a small
    part of the Gnutella network.
  </li>
  <li>
    New icons for showing node state (leaf or ultra mode).
  </li>
  <li>
    The GTK2 front-end is no longer experimental, albeit it is slower than
    the GTK1.2 front-end.  This is due to the somewhat inefficient
    implementation of the underlying GTK library.  Don't use GTK2 unless you
    have the equivalent of a 1 GHz Intel chip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added client-side PFSP support (partial file sharing). GTKG can download
    from servers holding partial files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added full PARQ support (Passive / Active Remote Queuing), both for
    upload and downloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    New Gnet statistics: flow-controlled packets per TTL and hops.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Type" column in the Gnet connection pane was turned into "Flags".
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for GGEP in pings/pongs/pushes: those packets are now
    accepted and forwarded to connections advertising GGEP support.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "use surplus bandwidth" setting: all unused bandwidth for Gnet or
    HTTP can be stolen by the other in case it needs some.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added count for total bytes uploaded and downloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for vendor-specific messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    New hops-flow support: remote flow-controlled connections can now warn
    us that they are flow-controlling us, and so we can drop queries
    immediately instead of sending them, saving outgoing bandwidth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will now show the GTKG version in query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    The queue now shows the count of alive downloads, as well as the queue
    count.  An "alive" download is an entry for which the remote server
    replies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed the connection algorithm: will now attempt to connect to more
    nodes than really configured, dropping the surplus connections later,
    when needed at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    Filters out hostile IP addresses.
  </li>
  <li>
    New "Fileinfo" pane in the download screen.  Not finished, but will show
    the currently registered downloads and their status.
  </li>
  <li>
    Domain name resolution for Gnutella web cache are now done
    asynchronously.  The GUI will no longer freeze due to a DNS request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some performance improvements: removed the most important bottlenecks.
  </li>
</ul>

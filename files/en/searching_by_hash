<h1>Searching by hash and by magnet-link</h1>

<h2>Searching by urn:sha1:</h2>

<p>
  If you want to search a file by its SHA1 hash, just enter it into the search 
  box and press enter, <em>gtk-gnutella-0.91.tar.gz</em> for example has 
  <em>urn:sha1:3OYPL2DQ3C6VFCWZZCB3GAZGBEQVIPSO</em><br>
  If you want to find out the SHA1 of one of the files you are sharing, try to 
  use something like:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cat ~/.gtk-gnutella/sha1_cache | grep gtk-gnutella-0.91.tar.gz
  <strong>3OYPL2DQ3C6VFCWZZCB3GAZGBEQVIPSO</strong>   649623  1037522542  /my/shared/files/gtk-gnutella-0.91.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>
  The bold thing is the encoded sha1 hash of that file. Now to search for it, 
  just put <em>urn:sha1:</em> in front of it and let it go.<br>
  There are additional methods of getting a SHA1. Just look into our 
  <a href="/tools/">tools</a> directory.
</p>
  
<h2>Searching by magnet: link</h2>

<p>
  Searching by <a href="http://magnet-uri.sf.net">magnet link</a> is currently 
  not completely supported (you can't click on a link from a browser) but you 
  can copy and paste the link into the search field of gtk-gnutella and it 
  will open a new search for that file.

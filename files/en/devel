<h2>Call for help</h2>
<p>
  The current version of gtk-gnutella is running well, but it is in no way 
  up to date with the latest gnutella standards. The "major players" of 
  gnutella (Limewire, BearShare, Shareaza, Gnucleus) implement 
  features like Tiger Tree Hashing which gtk-gnutella still doesn't yet. 
  Other possibly interesting features are XML-Query schemes (e.g. searching 
  by title, size, genre of files), magnet:-Links, and Download Proxies. GTKG 
  lacks all of them right now.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, gtk-gnutella has some features the major players lack,
  such as PARQ for passive queuing and TLS support for encrypted connections.
  Gtk-gnutella is also a very efficient C implementation with a low memory
  footprint and low CPU usage.  It's probably among the fastest clients today.
</p>
<p>
  Raphael Manfredi and Richard Eckart, the current lead developers, are 
  doing a great job, however Richard is busy with university and Raphael 
  has job and family, so their time for coding is limited. Since GTKG is 
  open source, it depends on people improving it.
</p>
<p>
  Now to the important questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Do you know C well enough to start helping to code new functionalities
    into gtk-gnutella, to help make it the best native Unix client?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you have literary skills and/or a taste for good documentation?  GTKG
    currently lacks good documentation, and the current developers are busy...
    developing, to be precise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you want to contribute, but do not know exactly what to do?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If yes, subscribe yourself to the developers 
  <a href="?page=mailing">
  mailing list</a> and send a message to it. Don't start to code right now, 
  let's see if there are other people that want to help implementing the 
  same thing and make a team with them. Please also read the 
  <a href="?page=developers_howto">"Developers Howto"</a>.

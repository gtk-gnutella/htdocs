<h1>GWebCache</h1>

<p>
  gtk-gnutella supports the <a href="http://www.gnucleus.com/gwebcache">
    GWebCache</a> system, which provides gnutella clients with a bootstrapping 
  method. This is needed for a gnutella client to find hosts to connect to 
  when it has never been connected to the gnutella network (gnet) before.
</p>
  
<p>
  If you want to support gnutella and you have a stable web server running, 
  you can run a script on it that provides this functionality.  It costs about 
  100 MB of traffic per month and the more people that run it, the less 
  traffic everyone will have. The scripts are available for PHP, ASP and 
  ColdFusion. 
</p>

<p>
  After your script is up and running, you can send a e-mail to our 
  <a href="?page=mailing">development mailing list</a> and to the 
  maintainer of the GWebCache Homepage (see his e-mail address at the bottom 
  of his page).<br>

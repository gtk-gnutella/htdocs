<h1>GWebCache</h1>

<p>
  Gtk-Gnutella supports the <a href="http://www.gnucleus.com/gwebcache/">
  GWebCache</a> system which provides Gnutella clients with a bootstrapping 
  method. Gnutella clients depend on bootstrap server to find hosts to connect
  to when they join the Gnutella network for the first time.
</p>
  
<p>
  If you want to support Gnutella and have a stable server running, 
  you could provide a bootstrap server. A GWebCache takes about 
  1-5 GB of traffic per month and the more people that run it, the less 
  traffic everyone will have.
  Although there are scripts available for Perl, PHP, ASP and ColdFusion,
  these are not recommended because they cause a lot of load for the
  server. Unfortunately, the quality of these scripts is also rather poor
  with only a few exceptions. Therefore it is recommended to use a dedicated
  web server optimized for this purpose such as
  <a href="http://www.ghostwhitecrab.de/crab/">GhostWhiteCrab</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There is also a light-weight bootstrap alternative for Gnutella called UDP
  Host Cache or <a href="http://www.the-gdf.org/wiki/index.php?title=UHC">UHC</a>
  for short. This uses significantly less resources and causes fewer traffic.
  Gtk-Gnutella and GhostWhiteCrab support this bootstrap method as well. Thus,
  you can GhostWhiteCrab to provide a GWebCache, an UDP Host Cache or both.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Beware:</b> Make sure you use a dedicated hostname for the bootstrap
  server you provide. Removing the DNS record will be the only way to
  stop the traffic when you decide to discontinue the service.
</p>

<p>
  After your bootstrap server is up and running, you can send an e-mail to our 
  <a href="?page=mailing">development mailing list</a> or submit
  the URL of your GWebCache at <a href="http://gcachescan.jonatkins.com/"
  >Jon Atkins' GWebCache Scan Report site</a>.

<h4>April 1st, 2011 -- Binary for Microsoft Windows available!</h4>

<p>Version 0.96.9 has been ported to Microsoft Windows and is now available
for downloading.</p>

<p>All the gtk-gnutella features are available and the program runs on Windows
with the same low-CPU and low-memory usage as when running under UNIX-like
operating systems, including the gtk-gnutella shell (but then you have to
launch it through the command line, not through the GUI by double-clicking
on the icon).</p>

<p>Porting was done by your gtk-gnutella development team, by creating a thin
POSIX-like layer on top of which the rest of the code can run without changes
compared to the UNIX version.  Note that this has nothing to do with Cygwin,
and the resulting program is a <bold>native</bold> executable not requiring
any Cygwin library.</p>

<p>You can download the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-gnutella/files/gtk-gnutella/0.96.9/gtk-gnutella-0.96.9-18885.exe/download">installer</a> and the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-gnutella/files/gtk-gnutella/0.96.9/gtk-gnutella-0.96.9-18885.exe.asc/download">PGP signature</a> as usual.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy the quality of gtk-gnutella on Windows!

<h4>24. June 2002, Version 0.90 beta released</h4>
<p>
After nearly 3 months of development efforts, we are proud to present the
new 0.90 beta version. It features <em>many</em> changes since the latest stable
0.85 release.  Among them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All configuration can now be made from the GUI.
<li>Fully redesigned search filters to work like ipchains/iptable on Linux.
<li>Obsoleted experimental "auto-download", superseded by the new filtering
code.
<li>Added Gnutella bandwidth management (0.85 already had HTTP bandwidth
management, but it was not configurable via the GUI).
<li>Both HTTP and Gnet bandwidth is now displayed real time.
<li>Added full HUGE support (Hash/URN Gnutella Extensions).
<li>Added support for local host preference.
<li>Gtk-Gnutella can do traffic compression when connecting to a node that
also supports it.
<li>Upload and downloads will now show User-Agent/Server information.
<li>Added status to the download queue.
<li>You can now freeze the download queue whilst manipulating it.
<li>Searches can now be listed on the left side of the screen, or as tabs
like in the previous versions.
<li>Added automatic banning of servents that are hammering us.
<li>Many more cool new features that you'll discover whilst playing with it.
</ul>
<p>
We hope you will like this version.  We believe gtk-gnutella is one of the
most advanced and efficient Gnutella servent available on Unix today.

  <strong>These are some of the changes made since 0.92.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GTK-Gnutella now supports Partial File serving, both as a client and as a 
    server. As soon as a download is started, it can be used as an alternate 
    source for others even though the download is not completed yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a mismatch happens during downloading, the file can now be 
    automatically removed and restarted again. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved GUI to specify better which downloads should be cleared from the 
    list (completed, failed, unavailable). 
  </li>
  <li>
    Collects alternate download locations aquired from query hits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for hostname instead of only an ip. If you have a dynamic ip but 
    got a static hostname, for example a .dyndns.org address, gtk-gnutella can 
    try to connect to the ip associated with the hostname.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Sends out alternate locations which should not be tried.
  </li>
  <li>
    Won't send full headers when short on bandwith.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any changes in settings are now automatically saved, there is no need to 
    quit the client anymore to make sure the settings are saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Running gtk-gnutella in Auto peermode should no longer cause a crash.
  </li>
  <li>
    New addresses in hostiles.txt to protect against malicious hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
    gwcache.boot was cleaned up. Dead links were removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remote control should actually work without crashing gtk-gnutella.
  </li>
  <li>
    The build problems which occured in 0.92.1 due to the switch to metaconfig 
    should be (mostly) gone. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Code cleanup to build on more platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    GTK2 interface currently does not have a maintainer, not all options which 
    are available in the GTK1 interface might have made it in the GTK2 
    interface.
  </li>

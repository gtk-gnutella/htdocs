<h4>22 October 2017, Version 1.1.13 Released</h4>

<p>This release primarily addresses issues that were left-over in 1.1.12. Do
   not use that previous release, migrate from 1.1.11 to 1.1.13 directly!</p>

<p>The main issue was that of Partial File Sharing. Numerous bugs, dating
   from 7 years or more, were lurking because my local configuration had
   switched PFS off for testing, and it had never been turned back on! In
   particular, completed files were not properly shared, it was not possible to
   upload their THEX since it was not recomputed, and the files were not
   properly indexed in the Query Routing Table due to bugs in the background
   task layer.</p>

<p>In case of a crash, we now dump the value of all the Gnutella properties
   to be able to spot configurations that deviate from the norm. Too many bugs
   were reported and ignored because they could not be reproduced, often due to
   not having the same setup when attempting to debug!</p>

<p>Another nasty bug was fixed: it was not possible to change the IP support
   configuration without causing an immediate crash. The reason is due to a
   change that was integrated in 1.1.12 to allow IPv6 UDP traffic from G2 nodes.
   The problem was that this created an extra client stack on top of the
   low-level UDP traffic scheduler and it was not properly cleaned-up when
   switching IP configurations, leading to an assertion failure!</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Append all Gnutella properties to the crashlog file.</li>
<li>At startup, do not needlessly request TTH if we have it cached
    already.</li>
<li>Optimized requests for library scan / QRP rebuild, avoiding multiple
    events.</li>
<li>Allow TTH computation for seeded files.</li>
<li>Obsolete and stale entries are now removed from the SHA1 cache.</li>
<li>[GTK] Added GUI events on more fileinfo changes.</li>
<li>[GTK] Show information about recomputed TTH for seeded files.</li>
<li>Prune unshared entries from SHA1 cache at startup.</li>
<li>Persist information about seeded files in the ASCII fileinfo
    database.</li>
<li>Remove unneeded libraries from the default GTK2 ldflags.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Was not able to properly seed completed files; fixed
    <code>shared_file_path()</code>.</li>
<li>Was not always updating QRP on the UP side after a library change.</li>
<li>Could have background tasks stuck after cancelling a multi-ref'ed
    one.</li>
<li>Dynamic querying timeout was not properly computed (made too small).</li>
<li>Changing from "IPv6 &amp; IPv4" to "IPv4 only" mode caused a crash.</li>
<li>Restored ability for "shutdown -r" to work.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>prop_to_typed_string()</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>s_where()</code> to log a stacktrace on stderr only.</li>
<li>Added <code>tt_slice_size()</code> to compute slice length per leaf in
    the TTH.</li>
<li>New <code>crash_dumper_add()</code> to register crash dumper
    callbacks.</li>
<li>No panicing when thread cannot block but was actually suspended.</li>
<li>Was unduly offsetting stacktrace by one extra level.</li>
<li><code>bg_sched_sleep()</code>: don't reduce runcount on exiting task!</li>
<li><code>bg_sched_timer()</code>: added run count consistency check.</li>
<li><code>bg_sched_timer()</code>: fixed logging of task's run time.</li>
<li><code>bg_task_cancel()</code>: log task address as well, not just the
    task name.</li>
<li><code>bg_task_wakeup()</code>: must clear user sleeping flag.</li>
<li><code>crash_restart_notify()</code>: use smarter
    <code>crash_exit()</code>.</li>
<li><code>crash_try_reexec()</code>: suspend other threads as a
    precaution.</li>
<li><code>deflate_flushed()</code>: suppressed soft assertion.</li>
<li><code>dq_results_expired()</code>: fixed improper timeout
    computation.</li>
<li><code>fi_free()</code>: cut any pending reference by uploads!</li>
<li><code>fi_tigertree_check()</code>: more verbose in case of errors.</li>
<li><code>file_info_moved()</code>: must update fi-&gt;modified as well.</li>
<li><code>file_info_remove_source()</code>: removed unused discard
    parameter.</li>
<li><code>file_info_retrieve()</code>: also validate that DONE is
    consistent.</li>
<li><code>file_info_shared_sha1()</code>: do not share bad files.</li>
<li><code>get_file_to_upload_from_urn()</code>: factorized code.</li>
<li><code>huge_update_hashes()</code>: enforce one sync of SHA1 cache every
    minute.</li>
<li><code>huge_verify_callback()</code>: use
    <code>shared_file_indexed()</code>.</li>
<li><code>node_udp_disable()</code>: was not disabling the G2 UDP IPv6
    node.</li>
<li><code>parse_and_append_cache_entry()</code>: discard obsolete / stale
    entries.</li>
<li><code>qrt_compressed()</code>: fixed outdated comments.</li>
<li><code>qrt_diff_1()</code>: was never considering change.</li>
<li><code>request_sha1()</code>: don't request TTH if we have it cached.</li>
<li><code>shared_file_fileinfo_unref()</code>: clear fileinfo pointer.</li>
<li><code>shared_file_from_fileinfo()</code>: copy TTH atom as well, if
    any.</li>
<li><code>shared_file_is_shareable()</code>: be stricter for partial
    files.</li>
<li><code>shared_file_path()</code>: must process sf-&gt;fi correctly!</li>
<li><code>upload_file_present()</code>: loudly warn when completed file
    changed on disk.</li>
<li><code>upload_file_present()</code>: loudly warn when file not
    shareable.</li>
<li><code>verify_update()</code>: loudly warn when "progress" callback stops
    processing.</li>

</ul>

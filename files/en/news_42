<h4>6 May 2005, Version 0.95.1 Released</h4>

<p>
  Version 0.95.1 is a stability release. Stability has been greatly
  improved since 0.95, so if you had any kind of trouble with 0.95
  then these problems are likely to be gone. 
  As usual everyone is encouraged to upgrade to the new version.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bitzi tickets are now persistently cached so that tickets are
      available again after restarting GTKG.</li>
	<li>Improved Unicode support:
	  <ul>
	  <li>The use of Unicode in queries now matches that of other Gnutella
		clients. This will make it easier to search for file names which
		contain non-Latin characters. At the time of release only
		Gtk-Gnutella 0.95.1 and Limewire will respond properly to Unicode
		queries.</li>
	  <li>Files are shared with their names converted to UTF-8, and
		downloads are stored with UTF-8 file names.</li>
	  <li>Unicode support is now built-in, we no longer depend on the ICU
		library.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Search improvements:
	  <ul>
	  <li>It is now possible to enter negative matches in search strings. If
		you enter "blah -blubb -nada" as search string, results matching
		"blubb" or "nada" are automagically filtered.</li>
	  <li>The search filter allows filtering for files larger than 4 GiB and
		you can also use suffixes like KB, KiB, MB, MiB etc.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>[GTK2] GUI updates:
	  <ul>
	  <li>You can drag & drop items under Downloads->Files e.g., to pass
		them to a audio/video player, picture viewer etc. Drag & drop is
		dangerous when used on files from unknown sources. You have been
		warned.</li>
	  <li>GnutellaNet has a new item "Reverse DNS lookup" in its context
		menu to perform a lookup of the peer's IP address.</li>
	  <li>XML data contained in search results is shown in the results
		details pane.</li>
	  <li>The search edit field has been moved to the top.</li>
	  <li>The Downloads pane was split into "Active Sources" and "Queue".</li>
	  <li>Compatible with GTK 2.6.x and older versions.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The GUI uses SI prefixes according to IEC 60027-2 (2000-11) Ed. 2.0
	  everywhere, so hard disk vendors won't fool you any longer.</li>
	<li>Compatibility fixes to allow compilation on more architectures,
	  including 64 bit architectures.</li>
	<li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Systems with a sendfile() that is not largefile compatible work
		again. On platforms without sendfile() we now use mmap() for
		improved efficiency.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>There are now two hostiles.txt, a system-wide ("global") and one in
	  the ~/.gtk-gnutella directory. So you only need to put private
	  additions into ~/.gtk-gnutella/hostiles.txt. These files are also
	  automagically reloaded on change, so you don't need to restart
	  Gtk-Gnutella to make the changes effective.</li>
	<li>Updated listings for geographic information, bogus addresses and
	  spam sites.</li>
	<li>Greatly enhanced stability as compared to 0.95 due to many bug
	  fixes. Other noteworthy bugs fixed are:</li>
	<li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Gtk-Gnutella as ultrapeer was not routing any searches iff uploads
		had been disabled.</li>
	  <li>Problems with the UDP/TCP port setting have been fixed (bug
	  #1091827).</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>German, Japanese, and Spanish translation updated.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>These are some of the changes made since 0.93.1 stable:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Numerous GUI updates:
    <ul>
      <li>
        GTK1 now supports grouped searches and grouped downloads, like GTK2 
        did.
      </li>
      <li>
        GTK1 and GTK2 GUIs were brought in sync feature-wise, as much as 
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gnet pane will now show leaf nodes and normal nodes in light gray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed memory leak problems in the GTK2 interface that slipped into 
        0.93.1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth requirements to become an ultranode were lowered significantly. 
    This is due to the filtering of SHA1 queries through QRP now, instead of
    systematically forwarding them: gtk-gnutella assumes all servents out 
    there include the SHA1 URNs in their QRP tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a result of the above, default amount of leaf nodes was increased. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a special fix for BearShare: the HTTP headers which gtk-gnutella 
    emitted used continuations, and were well-formed, but BearShare was
    misparsing those, causing it to enter an endless loop...
  </li>
  <li>
    Search results are now buffered by the GUI for burst updates, which 
    reduces CPU usage and the amount of redrawing significantly.  The 
    buffering time is configurable from the GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gtk-gnutella is now fully compliant with LimeWire regarding I18N queries, 
    provided you have the ICU library.  Otherwise, it should be OK for roman 
    charsets only.
  </li>
</ul>

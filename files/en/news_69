<h4>2 July 2014, Version 1.1.0 Released</h4>

<p>This is a major release introducing new features and making gtk-gnutella a
   multi-threaded application with drastic performance boosts for background
   tasks like file hashing or library rescanning.</p>

<p>Another major feature is the added support for the G2 search protcol: we
   are connecting to G2 hubs as a leaf, answer to search / browse requests from
   G2 hosts. We also use G2 to issue our own searches. Finally, we freely
   exchange files with G2 hosts (downloading and uploading).</p>

<p>The G2 protocol was further extended to make sure G2 query hits convey as
   much information as Gnutella query hits, in particular for alt-loc
   propagation and TLS support. The G2 semi-reliable UDP layer is also
   leveraging the new features designed for the corresponding Gnutella layer
   (cumulative and extended acknowledgments), gracefully falling back to legacy
   features if the remote host is not able to understand the new features.</p>

<p>A critical bug was fixed: reception of carefully crafted invalid DHT
   messages would lead to an immediate crash, an open door for Denial of Service
   (DoS) attacks. That bug has been present since 0.97 (release of August
   2011).</p>

<p>Last but not least, the code base has now been checked by Coverity. There
   was a very low defect rate of 0.26 (amount of true defects per thousand lines
   of code) and all problems were fixed.</p>

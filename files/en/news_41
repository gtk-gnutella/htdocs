<h4>27 November 2004, Version 0.95 Released</h4>

<p>With the release of version 0.95 Gtk-Gnutella supports the
state-of-the-art features of the Gnutella network. In terms of
Gnutella features version 0.94 is now considered a deprecated
servent. Every Gtk-Gnutella user must upgrade to 0.95 as soon as
possible to get the expected performance from the network and keep it
healthy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>GUI updates:
    <ul>
      <li>Enable drag and drop for magnet links</li>
      <li>[GTK1] Search results have less columns, and the hit details
          are now displayed in a separate pane underneath.</li>
      <li>Visual progress indicator correctly shows newly downloaded
          fragments, shows fragments currently available for download more
	  accurately, and active downloads are marked with arrows.</li>
      <li>The maximum amount of search results has been lowered to 1000.  
          Please use filters or more specific queries to find what you are
	  looking for if you get many search results.</li>
      <li>A detailed view has been added to the search results to show all
          available information for a search result.</li>
      <li>The status bar will now give feedback about the contacted
          host caches.</li>
      <li>Gnutella node stats can now show how many bytes were
          sent/received.</li>
      <li>In the node pane, right-clicking now allows to configure
          which columns should be displayed, just like in the search
          pane.</li>
      <li>More general statistics in the stats pane.  It is possible
          to see TCP and/or UDP traffic stats separately (for messages
          only, not flow-control).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Bitzi support has been added to retrieve additional information on
      possible downloads. See http://bitzi.com/ for details.</li>
  <li>The geographic location of hosts can now be shown courtesy of
      MaxMind.</li>

  <li>Recently developed features of the Gnutella network are now
      supported:
    <ul>
      <li>High outdegree provides better connectivity between Gnutella
          hosts. The maximum TTL in the network is now 4 and ultra nodes
          must maintain at least a connection with 30 peers.</li>
      <li> Last-hop QRP between ultra peers.</li>
      <li>Dynamic querying support, allows selective querying of peers
          instead of simply broadcasting the query. It is used for leaf
          queries and for your queries when running as an ultra node.</li>
      <li>OOB (out of band) query hits lets other servents deliver
          search results directly to you instead of going through the
          Gnutella network.</li>
      <li>OOB proxied queries, allowing direct hit delivery at the
          ultra node level for queries emitted by legacy leaves.</li> 
      <li>GTKG will now prevent firewalled hosts from running as ultra
          nodes.</li>
      <li>In "auto mode", GTKG will revert to leaf mode when uploads
          are stalling at an abnormally high rate, indicating bandwidth is
          saturated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>UDP is now also supported as a transport protocol in addition to
      TCP. You may need to make changes to your firewall settings to take
      full advantage of this.  The UDP port used is the same as the one
      used for TCP.</li>
  <li>Firewall detection has been improved to include UDP firewalling
      detection.</li>
  <li>Clock skew computation for hosts not running NTP has been redesigned.
      Also, GTKG will now automatically detect a locally running
      NTP.</li>
  <li>Large file support has been added, so that files over 2 Gb can
      be used.</li>
  <li>Japanese translation added.</li>
  <li>French and German translation updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Checksums of the source tarball:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MD5 (gtk-gnutella-0.95.tar.bz2) = de2ff4973c975ee16cdd69ca72c06bcd</li>
  <li>SHA1 (gtk-gnutella-0.95.tar.bz2) = 38be3abced5add254f7a0fff88b7e7e1d0e47fa8</li>

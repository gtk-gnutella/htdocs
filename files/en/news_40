		<ul>
			<li>File info pane renamed to "Downloads".</li>
    			<li>Downloads pane renamed to "Sources".</li>
     			<li>Progress of a download can now visualized. This will show which fragment of a file was downloaded, which fragment gtk-gnutella is currently downloading and which fragments are availalbe on the Gnutella network.</li>
	   		<li>Uploads and download sources pane now contain a visual progressbar.</li>
			<li>The GTK2 GUI can now be resized smaller than a width of 933 pixels.</li>

	<li>If no default port was specified, gtk-gnutella will now bind to a random port and will use that port from then on.<br />

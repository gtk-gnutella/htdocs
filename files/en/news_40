<h4>10 July 2004, Version 0.94 Released</h4>
<p>
  While 0.93 was improved for stability with the 0.93.4 release, the just released 0.94 contains some nice new features, while it should be at least as stable as 0.93.4:
</p>
  <ul>
  	<li> GUI updates:
		<ul>
			<li>File info pane renamed to "Downloads".</li>
    			<li>Downloads pane renamed to "Sources".</li>
     			<li>Progress of a download can now be visualized. This will show which fragment of a file has been downloaded, which fragment gtk-gnutella is currently downloading and which fragments are availalbe on the Gnutella network.</li>
	   		<li>Uploads and download sources pane now contain a visual progressbar.</li>
			<li>The GTK2 GUI can now be resized smaller than a width of 933 pixels.</li>
			<li>Search results now include an extension column, so you can sort by file extension if needed.</li>
			<li>The Gnet stats panel and the statusbar now include horizon statistics.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New Gnutella extension HSEP/0.2 included. This will give you an estimation of the horizon size. This includes the number of reachable nodes, files and the total size of all files on the network.</li>
	<li>The remote shell now includes a command "HORIZON", which will output horizon stats.</li>
	<li>If no default port is specified, gtk-gnutella will now bind to a random port and will use that port from then on.<br />
	    If you are behind a firewall and have routed a port to gtk-gnutella, please check that gtk-gnutella is still running on the port you want it to!</li>
	<li>Will parse up to 150 hosts in a gwebcache reply to bootstrap from.</li>
	<li>New hostcache to make gtk-gutella connect to the network more quickly.</li>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  The filtering code in gtk-gnutella 0.90 was dramatically improved. This 
  small howto will tell you how to deal with the power given by those filters.
</p>

<p>
  Note that filters will only be applied to new search results as they come 
  in. There is currently no way to apply them to the results that are already 
  in the list.
</p>

<h3>State flags</h3>

<p>
  When a search result arrives at the filtering engine it has two state flags; 
  DOWNLOAD and DISPLAY. Initially the state flags are in an "undefined" state, 
  and by applying various tests to each result, these flags can be set to DO 
  and DON'T.
</p>

<p>
  Note: As soon as both state flags are defined, i.e. set to either DO or 
  DON'T, the filtering is aborted, and the application will proceed to DISPLAY 
  and/or DOWNLOAD if the respective flags are set. Furthermore, each of the 
  flags can be set only once (subsequent attempts to set them will be silently 
  ignored), so the order in which you set up the rules is quite important.
</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>
  A filter is basically a set of rules. There are three types of 
  user-definable filters; Global filters, Search filters, and Free filters;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    There are two global filters; "pre" and "post".  The "pre" filter is 
    applied to all results before they go to their respective search filter. 
    They can be used to filter away certain hosts, restrict which types of 
    files you see (i.e. ignore all ".html" files), etc. The global "post" 
    filter will be processed after the search results have gone through their 
    search filter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Search filters are filters that are connected to a specific ongoing 
    search. When you search for something, every result will be sent to its 
    respective search filter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Free filters are perhaps the most interesting ones.  You can practically 
    write "sub-routines" that can be called from any of the other filters. For 
    example, you can define a "movie" filter that filters away files that are 
    less than a certain size, and don't match any of the common video file 
    extensions. Then you can use the "jump" rule in your search filters to 
    call your "movie" filter.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
  There are several different rule types. Most of them have some flags that 
  might warrant an explanation;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "Invert condition" can be checked to invert the test in question. An 
    example; If you're looking for an mp3 file, and your search results are 
    cluttered with non-relevant hits, you can set up a rule that says; If 
    filename DOES NOT end with ".mp3", flag it as "DON'T DISPLAY".  Inverted 
    conditions are marked with an X in the rule list.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Active" flag can be checked and unchecked to temporarily enable or 
    disable a rule.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Mark only" flag is special, and is likely to be replaced by something 
    more generic, but currently it can be used to mark search results with a 
    different colour to make the matching results stand out from the rest. To 
    achieve that effect, check "Mark only", and select "DON'T DISPLAY" as the 
    target.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Size rules</h3>

<p>
  Size rules have three similar uses;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If only "minimum size" is given, the rule will trigger a jump to the 
    selected target if the size is less than the value given.  This can be 
    used to filter away small files when looking for something large, such as 
    a video clip.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both "minimum" and "maximum" is defined, the rule will cause a jump if 
    the size is between the two values.  <li>If only "maximum" is given, the 
    filter will jump if the result's size is larger than the given value.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Name rules</h3>

<p>
  Name rules perform tests on the results' filenames. The "Condition" pulldown 
  should be quite self-explanatory.
</p>

<h3>Flag rules</h3>

<p>
  The flag rules can be used to filter results based on the hosting servent's 
  flags; "Stable", "Busy "and "Push". For example, if you are behind a 
  firewall and unable to received pushed files, you can add a rule that 
  directs all results with the Push flag set to DON'T DISPLAY.
</p>

<h3>Jump rules</h3>

<p>
  The jump rule is used to either set a DO or DON'T flag directly, or it can 
  be used to call one of the free filters for subsequent testing.
</p>

<h3>IP rules</h3>

<p>
  IP rules filter results based on the servent's IP address. A typical use for 
  this is to ignore certain spammer hosts which return bogus hits.  Or one can 
  auto-download results that come from a certain IP address or network which 
  is known to be fast.
</p>

<h3>urn:sha1 rules</h3>

<p>
  The urn:sha1 rules are special, and can't be edited manually. They can only 
  be added via the right-click-menu in the search results window. They are 
  used to match a given file, and flag it for either DON'T DISPLAY (if picked 
  via the "ignore" menu item) or DOWNLOAD (if picked via the "auto-download" 
  item).
</p>

<h3>State rules</h3>

<p>
  State rules can be used to process results that have already been through a 
  number of other tests.  A common application for this rule is to 
  automatically download results that haven't been marked as DON'T DISPLAY. 
  See under "Sample rulesets" for a full example.
</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you want to filter away certain results permanently (based on e.g. file 
    size or name), create a free filter called "Ignore", and put two jumps in 
    it; one to "DON'T DISPLAY" and one to "DON'T DOWNLOAD". Now you can jump 
    to "Ignore" instead of "DON'T DISPLAY". This way the filter execution will 
    abort immediately, instead of trying to run the rest of the calling filter.
  </li>
  <li>
    To see which files have been tagged for download, add a rule to your 
    Global (post) filter; If state flag "DOWNLOAD" is set, jump to "DON'T 
    DISPLAY" with "Mark only".  Now your auto-downloaded files will show up in 
    a different colour in the search results.
  </li>
  <li>
    Apparently some pieces of software like to respond to every search they 
    come across, and feed back bogus results. You may have come across files 
    with names like "!!_YEEHAA_!!_(search term).exe" or "secret paysite 
    passwords for (search term).html" and similar. Zygo has a nice trick to 
    weed them out: Specify your search with the words jumbled, like "clones of 
    the attack", and use a filter to remove results that has the same order of 
    the words; "If file matches the regexp "clones.*of.*the.*attack", DON'T 
    DISPLAY".
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample filters</h3>

<p>
  Here is a sample "movie" filter as mentioned earlier.  If you set this up as 
  a free filter, you can jump to it from the search filters to filter out a 
  lot of bogus hits. Also, when doing a new search, you can select it on the 
  default filter pulldown directly.

<p>
  Here is a filter that will download MPEG music videos of Rammstein tracks.  
  The trick is to use inverted conditions (note the X'es in front), and the 
  last rule that will mark all files that aren't flagged as DON'T DISPLAY with 
  DOWNLOAD.

	    <td>DON'T DISPLAY</td>
    </tr>

	    <td>DON'T DISPLAY</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	    <td>X</td>
	    <td>If flag DON'T DISPLAY</td>
	    <td>DOWNLOAD</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

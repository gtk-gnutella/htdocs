<h4>9 September 2015, Version 1.1.4 Released</h4>

<p>This release is mostly a bug-fixing release.</p>

<p>One major bug (leading to crash) was found in the G2 frame parsing layer:
   a carefully crafted G2 packet sent to GTKG could crash it, leading to a
   Denial of Service. For that reason, an upgrade to 1.1.4 is strongly
   recommended.</p>

<p>The only major new feature is the added cleanups of the TTH cache and the
   crash log directory, to make sure we do not keep useless files on the disk
   forever.</p>

<p>Because the Phex servent is no longer maintained, there is now a
   workaround for that particular servent to ensure it can correctly download
   from GTKG.</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>[GTK2] Added tri-state column sorting in "property editor" preference
    pane.</li>
<li>[GTK2] Show icon + warning message when we have no TCP listening
    socket.</li>
<li>Added an "install-strip" target to all Makefiles to install with
    stripping.</li>
<li>Can no longer edit properties flagged as "internal" through shell or
    GUI.</li>
<li>Added new "session_start_stamp" property to hold the true starting
    time.</li>
<li>Added support for TTH cache cleanup.</li>
<li>Added automatic cleanup of the crash log directory.</li>
<li>New shell command "random stats" to display the statistics on random
    layer.</li>
<li>Workaround for Phex: always send X-Gnutella-Content-URN in upload
    replies.</li>
<li>Updated GeoIP database.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li><tt>upnp_natpmp_discovered()</tt>: detect when UPnP layer was shutdown
    and abort.</li>
<li>Fixed bad definition of XXTEA key, which led us to use only its first 4
    bytes.</li>
<li><tt>node_g2_read()</tt>: need to only read 3 bytes usually to determine
    frame length.</li>
<li><tt>thread_sp()</tt>: tweaked to defeat gcc 5.x optimization leading to a
    NULL return.</li>
<li>File moving: notify main thread as soon as file is completely copied.</li>
<li><tt>update_available_ranges()</tt>: lack of X-Available means file is
    full on server.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Under the Hood</h5>
<ul>
<li>Windows: added <tt>getppid()</tt> and <tt>statvfs()</tt> emulation, plus
    <tt>rmdir()</tt> support.</li>
<li>Improved the unpredictability of our random numbers.</li>
<li>Loudly warn if attempting a file-descriptor operation on a revoked
    descriptor.</li>
<li>Added <tt>compat_sendfile()</tt> with fallback to emulated version when
    necessary.</li>
<li>Added <tt>compat_statvfs()</tt> for portability and code
    simplification.</li>
<li>File moving operations now use <tt>sendfile()</tt> if available.</li>
<li>XFMT: made it loudly clear that comment nodes are ignored for now.</li>
<li>VMM: when debugging, trace large allocation spots.</li>
<li>VMM: raised maximum page cache lifetime from 3 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li><tt>page_cache_find_pages()</tt>: treat user memory as if under
    short-term strategy.</li>
<li><tt>filepath_basename()</tt>: optimize code when G_DIR_SEPARATOR is
    '/'.</li>
<li>Optimized <tt>CMP()</tt> to avoid branching regardless of the
    arguments.</li>
<li>Added <tt>ftw_foreach()</tt> to traverse a file system and process each
    entry.</li>
<li><tt>mingw_readdir()</tt>: do not change errno if it was left untouched by
    <tt>_wreaddir()</tt>.</li>
<li>Let mingw_{opendir,readdir,closedir} use normal types, not generic
    ones.</li>
<li><tt>mingw_stat()</tt>: added workaround for trailing "/" or "/." in
    paths.</li>
<li><tt>etree_traverse_internal()</tt>: minor optimization to avoid trailing
    +1 each time.</li>
<li>Added <tt>etree_sort()</tt> and <tt>etree_sort_with_data()</tt> to sort
    children of all nodes.</li>
<li>Changed signature of decoding base16 and base32 routines.</li>
<li>Regenerated Configure to fix the <tt>fdopendir()</tt> compile test.</li>
<li>Make sure pointer hashing distributes its trailing bits evenly.</li>
<li><tt>elist_merge_sort()</tt>: don't update tail, just do one single pass
    at the end.</li>
<li><tt>vmm_dump_pmap_log()</tt>: copy pmap data, then process dumping
    without locks.</li>

</ul>
